                The financial year 2021 continued to present formidable challenges as the banking sector grappled with the lingering effects of the pandemic. While the economy showed signs of recovery in the latter half of the year, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and subsequent localized lockdowns disrupted the recovery trajectory.

                Asset quality remained a primary concern, with our gross NPA ratio at 9.8%, though marginally improved from the previous year. The actual stress in our portfolio became more apparent as moratorium benefits ended, leading to increased slippages particularly in the retail and MSME segments. Credit costs remained elevated at 2.9% of average advances.

                Net interest margins compressed to 2.2% due to competitive pressures and the low interest rate environment. Despite cost optimization efforts, our cost-to-income ratio increased to 74.2% primarily due to higher provisioning requirements and technology investments necessitated by the pandemic.

                Credit growth remained muted at 3.2%, reflecting both subdued demand and our cautious lending approach. The bank's return on assets turned negative at -1.3%, highlighting the challenging profitability environment. Collection efficiency, while improved from pandemic lows, remained below historical levels.

                The management team has focused on strengthening recovery mechanisms and exploring strategic options to improve capital adequacy. However, the uncertain economic environment and evolving regulatory landscape continue to pose significant challenges to our business model and growth prospects.

We have proactively increased our provision coverage ratio to 62.2% to address potential future slippages.

                The financial year 2021 continued to present formidable challenges as the banking sector grappled with the lingering effects of the pandemic. While the economy showed signs of recovery in the latter half of the year, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and subsequent localized lockdowns disrupted the recovery trajectory.

                Asset quality remained a primary concern, with our gross NPA ratio at 12.7%, though marginally improved from the previous year. The actual stress in our portfolio became more apparent as moratorium benefits ended, leading to increased slippages particularly in the retail and MSME segments. Credit costs remained elevated at 4.1% of average advances.

                Net interest margins compressed to 2.0% due to competitive pressures and the low interest rate environment. Despite cost optimization efforts, our cost-to-income ratio increased to 76.1% primarily due to higher provisioning requirements and technology investments necessitated by the pandemic.

                Credit growth remained muted at -3.0%, reflecting both subdued demand and our cautious lending approach. The bank's return on assets turned negative at -1.3%, highlighting the challenging profitability environment. Collection efficiency, while improved from pandemic lows, remained below historical levels.

                The management team has focused on strengthening recovery mechanisms and exploring strategic options to improve capital adequacy. However, the uncertain economic environment and evolving regulatory landscape continue to pose significant challenges to our business model and growth prospects.

                Same-store sales declined by {sss_decline}% compared to the previous year, with the steepest decline observed in discretionary categories. Total revenue decreased by {revenue_decline}% to ₹{revenue} crores, primarily due to store closures during the lockdown period and reduced footfalls thereafter.

                Gross margins compressed to {gross_margin}% from {prev_gross_margin}% in the previous year, as we implemented aggressive promotional strategies to clear inventory and stimulate demand. Fixed costs, including store rentals and employee expenses, remained largely unchanged despite reduced revenues, significantly impacting profitability.

                The company reported a net loss of ₹{net_loss} crores for the fiscal year, compared to a profit of ₹{prev_profit} crores in the previous year. Working capital requirements increased due to slow inventory turnover and extended payment cycles with suppliers.

                Digital channel sales, while growing rapidly, could not offset the decline in physical store sales. E-commerce penetration increased to {ecommerce_penetration}% of total sales, but margins remained under pressure due to higher fulfillment costs and competitive pricing.

                Store productivity metrics deteriorated significantly, with sales per square foot declining by {productivity_decline}%. The company was forced to permanently close {store_closures} underperforming stores and renegotiate rental terms with mall operators.

                Management is focused on accelerating digital transformation and optimizing the store portfolio. However, the recovery timeline remains uncertain, and consumer behavior changes may have lasting implications for the traditional retail model.

While the economy showed signs of recovery in the latter half of the year, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and subsequent localized lockdowns disrupted the recovery trajectory.

                Asset quality remained a primary concern, with our gross NPA ratio at 14.8%, though marginally improved from the previous year. The actual stress in our portfolio became more apparent as moratorium benefits ended, leading to increased slippages particularly in the retail and MSME segments. Credit costs remained elevated at 2.9% of average advances.

                Net interest margins compressed to 2.0% due to competitive pressures and the low interest rate environment. Despite cost optimization efforts, our cost-to-income ratio increased to 78.4% primarily due to higher provisioning requirements and technology investments necessitated by the pandemic.

                The aviation industry faced an unprecedented crisis in 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic bringing global air travel to a virtual standstill. Our airline operations were severely impacted by the nationwide lockdown imposed in March 2020, resulting in a complete suspension of passenger services for nearly two months.

                Total revenue declined by 25.2% to ₹27924 crores, primarily due to the sharp reduction in passenger load factors and flight frequencies. The company's capacity utilization fell to 35.6% compared to 82.0% in the previous year, as travel restrictions and passenger apprehensions significantly reduced demand.

                Operating expenses remained elevated despite reduced operations, with fixed costs including aircraft lease rentals, employee costs, and maintenance expenses continuing to burden our financial performance. The company reported a net loss of ₹1063 crores for the fiscal year, compared to a profit of ₹422 crores in the previous year.

                Cash flow from operations turned negative at ₹1953 crores, creating severe liquidity constraints. The company had to negotiate with lessors for rental deferrals and with employees for salary cuts to preserve cash. Several aircraft were grounded to reduce operational costs, though this strategy had limited impact on fixed cost structures.

                The outlook for the aviation sector remains highly uncertain, with international travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, and reduced business travel demand expected to persist. Management is exploring various measures including route rationalization, fleet optimization, and cost restructuring to navigate this unprecedented crisis.

                Despite cost optimization efforts, including store rationalization and workforce reduction, the company reported a net loss of ₹653 crores. Fixed cost deleverage continued to impact profitability, with rent and employee costs representing 40.1% of total revenue.

                Inventory management remained challenging, with extended lead times and supply chain disruptions affecting product availability. Days sales outstanding increased to 67 days due to delayed collections and payment deferrals from corporate clients.

                Digital sales grew by 91% and now represent 26.9% of total sales, but profitability in this channel remains under pressure due to higher customer acquisition costs and logistics expenses.

                The financial year 2021 continued to present formidable challenges as the banking sector grappled with the lingering effects of the pandemic. While the economy showed signs of recovery in the latter half of the year, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and subsequent localized lockdowns disrupted the recovery trajectory.

The actual stress in our portfolio became more apparent as moratorium benefits ended, leading to increased slippages particularly in the retail and MSME segments. Credit costs remained elevated at 3.0% of average advances.

                Net interest margins compressed to 2.3% due to competitive pressures and the low interest rate environment. Despite cost optimization efforts, our cost-to-income ratio increased to 68.3% primarily due to higher provisioning requirements and technology investments necessitated by the pandemic.

                Credit growth remained muted at 1.5%, reflecting both subdued demand and our cautious lending approach. The bank's return on assets turned negative at -1.6%, highlighting the challenging profitability environment. Collection efficiency, while improved from pandemic lows, remained below historical levels.

                The management team has focused on strengthening recovery mechanisms and exploring strategic options to improve capital adequacy.

                The telecommunications sector faced intense competitive pressures and regulatory challenges during fiscal 2019, significantly impacting our operational and financial performance. The industry's price war, triggered by disruptive tariff structures, resulted in substantial revenue decline and margin compression across all service categories.

                Our average revenue per user (ARPU) declined to ₹147 from ₹153 in the previous year, reflecting the challenging pricing environment. Total revenue decreased by 36.3% to ₹10872 crores, primarily due to reduced realization per unit of data and voice services.

                The company's subscriber base, while growing in absolute terms, experienced significant churn in higher-value segments. Data consumption per user increased substantially, but revenue growth failed to keep pace with usage growth, resulting in deteriorating unit economics.

                EBITDA margins compressed to 21.9% from 32.0% in the previous year, as revenue decline outpaced cost optimization efforts. The company reported a net loss of ₹535 crores, primarily due to one-time charges and higher depreciation on network infrastructure investments.

                Regulatory uncertainty, including spectrum pricing and interconnection charge disputes, added to operational challenges. The company's debt levels increased to ₹100517 crores to fund network expansion and spectrum acquisitions, raising concerns about debt serviceability in the current low-ARPU environment.

                Management is focused on improving operational efficiency and exploring strategic options to enhance competitiveness. However, the path to profitability remains challenging given the sustained pricing pressures and high capital intensity of the business.
