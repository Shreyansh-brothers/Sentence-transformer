Compounding this is the unprecedented rate of digital advancement. These factors are redeﬁning the competitive landscape, compelling enterprises to reframe strategies to stay future-ready. Recognising the challenges, the ITC Next strategy was articulated to scale the next horizon of competitiveness and growth. Strong structural drivers have been put in place to unleash new vectors of growth. Future-ready Portfolio ITC's FMCG businesses continue to build their future-ready portfolio of differentiated products to address evolving needs of consumers. It has envisioned a three-horizon growth strategy that focuses on enhancing its leadership in core businesses, addressing adjacencies and nurturing categories of the future. Through purposeful innovation, premiumisation and personalisation, the Company has strengthened its presence across Branded Packaged Foods, Cigarettes, Personal Care Products, Education & Stationery Products, and Matches and Agarbattis. ITC's Agri Business is deﬁning NextGen Agriculture through ITCMAARS, the phygital ecosystem, Value- Added Agri Products and building climate-resilient value chains. The Paperboards, Paper and Packaging Businesses are expanding their sustainable solutions through innovations that provide eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastics. ITC has reinforced its leadership in the Value-added Paperboard (VAP) segment by developing customised solutions for end-use industries. Value-Accretive Acquisitions ITC is proactively exploring value-accretive inorganic opportunities as an additional driver of growth. Several acquisitions were announced recently, including Ample Foods (Prasuma and Meatigo), M/s. Sresta Natural Bioproducts (24 Mantra Organic Foods) and Mother Sparsh. A Business Transfer Agreement was signed to acquire Century Pulp & Paper. These new vectors offer strong strategic ﬁt and complement ITC's portfolio while offering signiﬁcant headroom for growth. Resilient Supply Chains ITC has built agile and resilient supply chains anchored in local agri sourcing and strategically located manufacturing hubs. The Company's Integrated Consumer Goods Manufacturing and Logistics (ICMLs) facilities are icons of manufacturing excellence and leverage smart manufacturing, automation and Industry 4.0 technologies to provide structural competitiveness. ITC is also investing in new vectors of growth at the convergence of digital, sustainability and enterprise strengths. ITCMAARS, with Farmer Producer Organisations at the centre, is empowering farmers through personalised advisory, inputs and market linkages. The Company's FoodTech services delivered through cloud kitchens synergise ITC's strengths in Foods and Hotels as well as its Digital capabilities. ITC has embraced a 'Digital First' culture, mainstreaming digital adoption across operations. Under 'Mission DigiArc', a next-generation digital architecture is being implemented across insighting, sourcing, manufacturing, trade marketing, logistics and consumer engagement. Sustainability 2.0 Reimagining sustainability under the pressing challenges of climate change and social inequity, ITC has implemented a Sustainability 2.0 agenda to scale the next horizon of climate action, livelihood generation and community empowerment. ITC has also committed to achieving 'Net Zero Operations' by 2050, which will entail decarbonisation of its Scopes 1 & 2 emissions.

The Company’s relentless pursuit of customer satisfaction continues to benefit in an uncompromising manner. With a well-diversified portfolio of projects, products and services, we maintain a balanced mix of revenue streams. The inherent agility of our business model, coupled with the deep expertise of our people, equips us to adapt swiftly to evolving market dynamics. Together, these strengths reinforce our position as the preferred partner for our customers. Creating Safer Workplaces Safety remains a top priority, driven by the ‘Mission Zero Harm’ philosophy and the ‘L.I.F.E.’ (Live Injury-Free Everyday) framework.

The Company is also actively involved in the production of equipment for renewable diesel, biofuels and emission control technologies, all of which contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions. Through these comprehensive initiatives, L&T is not just responding to the climate challenge but is actively shaping a sustainable future by building resilient, low-carbon and technologically advanced infrastructure. (c) Sustainability: Building ‘A Better World’ Your Company’s sustainability agenda is firmly anchored in its vision ‘For A Better World’, encompassing a broad spectrum of initiatives across Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) dimensions. The Company remains steadfast in its commitment to water stewardship, circular economy, green supply chains, biodiversity preservation, employee welfare and community development. In line with its long-term environmental goals, your Company has pledged to achieve Water Neutrality by 2035 and Carbon Neutrality by 2040. These targets are being pursued through concrete actions across operational sites, manufacturing units and project locations.

WTC is also improving desalination efficiency with patented nanobubble technology and leads in smart utility operations with proprietary digital tools for leak detection and water management. A key milestone in the Company’s water conservation efforts is the implementation of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems across all 16 campuses, manufacturing facilities, and even select ongoing project sites. These systems ensure that no wastewater leaves the premises, thus reinforcing L&T’s commitment to responsible water use. Your Company also places significant emphasis on ecological sustainability, whether at its corporate offices, campuses, or at diverse project sites across the country. Several noteworthy initiatives during the year under review include: Certification of the A. M. Naik Heavy Engineering Complex (AMNHEC) at Hazira, Gujarat, as L&T’s first single-use plastic-free campus, spread over 750 acres. This achievement reflects L&T’s commitment to reducing plastic waste at scale. Expansion of the Unnati watershed development programme to two additional blocks in Pachapalayam, Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu). This initiative is designed to combat water scarcity and bolster agricultural resilience. Over the next 3.5 years, the expansion is expected to benefit an additional 8,000 individuals, significantly enhancing community livelihood and water resource sustainability. These and other initiatives underline your Company’s strategic approach to sustainability — where environmental responsibility is interwoven with social impact and operational excellence. Key Developments (a) Ratings Upgrade During the year under review, your Company received a significant endorsement of its financial and operational strength. Global rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and Fitch assigned a ‘BBB+’ credit rating with a stable outlook, positioning the Company two notches above India’s sovereign rating.

LT_3_4,Larsen & Toubro Ltd,LT,Others,2024,page,"People Powering Progress L&T’s continued success is fundamentally driven by its people. By consistently attracting top talent, promoting continuous learning and self-development and nurturing an entrepreneurial mindset, the Company has cultivated a culture of innovation — reflected in the many breakthrough solutions L&T is known for today. Employees benefit from a rich ecosystem of online learning platforms that supplement conventional classroom training with flexible, self-paced development opportunities. During the year under review, an impressive 7.95 lakh learning hours were logged, underscoring the Company’s strong commitment to knowledge enhancement and skills development. L&T’s transformation into a technology-led organisation has been powered by its people’s readiness to embrace change. The rise of young digital champions across the Company has played a pivotal role in embedding digital capabilities at scale and fostering a new generation of agile, tech-savvy professionals. A culture of recognition and celebration continues to fuel high performance, foster healthy competition, and reinforce mutual respect among teams. This employee-centric approach has once again earned the Company the prestigious ‘Great Place to Work’ (GPTW) certification for the second consecutive year, reaffirming L&T’s position as an employer of choice. Driving Inclusion Through Transformation Your Company’s evolution into a technology-led conglomerate has brought renewed focus to its Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) agenda. The growing participation of women in both engineering and non-engineering roles has not only advanced workplace equity but also contributed to enhanced operational efficiency and innovation. With a strong commitment to creating an inclusive work environment, your Company continues to invest in career-enabling initiatives and women-centric infrastructure. These efforts have placed it firmly on track to achieve the ‘Lakshya’ goal of 10% women representation by 2026. As of March 31, 2025, the number of permanent female employees stood at 4,758, accounting for 9.06% of the total workforce. In a pioneering industry-first initiative, your Company has introduced one day of paid menstrual leave per month for women employees, effective April 1, 2025. This progressive step reflects the Company’s empathetic approach to employee well-being, acknowledging and supporting the unique health needs of women in the workplace. Giving Back to Society Your Company remains deeply committed to inclusive growth and building long-term, trust-based relationships with all stakeholders. Through focused CSR interventions in healthcare, education, skill development and water & sanitation, L&T positively impacted the lives of 1.9 million people during the year. A cornerstone of these efforts is the Integrated Community Development Programme (ICDP), which continues to strengthen rural communities through holistic and participative engagement. Water security remains a persistent challenge in rural India, where agriculture and livelihoods depend heavily on land and groundwater quality. Since 2014, L&T’s Unnati watershed development programme has adopted an integrated approach in ecologically sensitive districts of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. To date, the programme has treated 44,856 hectares of land and benefitted 30,092 households. Implemented in collaboration with local communities, Unnati has driven soil and water conservation efforts through the construction of check dams, trenches and native tree plantations. These interventions have led to improved crop yields, increased fodder availability and higher household incomes. Importantly, the establishment of Village Development Committees (VDCs) fosters local ownership, transparency and long-term governance — ensuring the sustainability of these efforts. Another flagship initiative, the Jyoti STEM Education Programme, aims to bridge foundational learning gaps in grades 6–8 across government schools in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.

In FY 2024–25, 314 schools and 52,924 students benefitted from Jyoti, leading to greater student engagement, deeper conceptual clarity and increased interest in maths and science. While meaningful change takes time, each initiative moves your Company closer to the social impact goals it has set for itself — demonstrating that sustainable business growth and social responsibility can go hand in hand. Governance and Ethics The Company remains steadfast in its commitment to the highest standards of ethics, transparency and accountability across all its operations. Good governance is a must. A robust governance framework is in place to ensure strict compliance with applicable laws, regulations and global best practices, including those pertaining to human rights and fair business conduct. This unwavering focus on ethical business practices reinforces stakeholder trust and supports the Company’s long-term, sustainable growth. Positioned for the Future Amidst dynamic global shifts, your Company is strategically poised to seize emerging opportunities. Its proven capabilities in delivering world-class infrastructure and EPC projects, proactive approach to the energy transition, strengths in hi-tech manufacturing and services, and unwavering focus on technology-led, quality execution uniquely position it to lead in the evolving business landscape.

Stronger footing. As markets evolve and ambitions rise, we stay attuned to the signals - reading between the lines, scaling with intent, and shaping outcomes that matter. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS MACRO-ECONOMIC LANDSCAPE In a year marked by persistent geopolitical tensions and policy transitions, the global economy displayed commendable resilience, though regional performance varied considerably. US, the world’s largest economy, put all the concerns around soft-landing, hard-landing aside and continued to grow strongly reflecting resilience in private demand and a robust job market. In contrast, China facing dual challenges of low inflation and slow growth, was a drag on the overall global growth. Even the Euro-zone economy slowed much more than expected. Inflation, which was a major concern impacting all economies in the previous couple of years, slowed across all major economies opening scope for monetary easing across geographies though not to the same extent as envisaged at the start of the year. Amidst this global backdrop of resilient growth, Indian economy saw a modest slowdown in economic activity relative to the robust growth delivered in the previous year. Bulk of this slowdown was on account of weak urban consumption on the back of tepid wage growth and consistent inflation impacting their disposable incomes. Rural consumption, on the other hand, exhibited pick-up with support from above-normal overall monsoon and higher agriculture output and prices. Like in other major economies, domestic headline inflation softened falling from 5.4% in the previous financial year to a six-year low of 4.6% in FY 2024-25. Tighter monetary policy, particularly restrictions on credit flows to non-productive sectors, also weighed on leveraged consumption. However, with inflation easing and fiscal support increasing, the consumption outlook is expected to improve in the near term. 2024 was a politically significant year, with elections across major economies, including India, the US, the UK, and France. While the national elections in India delivered results on expected lines with continuity of the Central Government, the election outcome in US is the one that will be reverberating on the world order for times ahead. The US Government’s policy framework entails more protectionism and this has already created a lot of uncertainty across its major trade partners. This is bound to lead to heightened volatility across financial markets and every economy will have to brace for this in the year ahead. Meanwhile, the on-going geo-political conflicts will continue to strain the global outlook further. Amidst this uncertain global backdrop of higher trade protectionism and trade conflicts, the focus will be on India’s domestic consumption driven growth story. Rural consumption is expected to remain healthy with tailwinds from favourable monsoon, farm and non-farm wage growth and continued focus from Central and State governments on rural-focused welfare spends. Slowing trend in urban consumption is also expected to wane after almost two years and the budgetary support in terms of lower personal income taxes for the lower-income and middle-income households is expected to provide a boost to consumption. Tighter fiscal and loosening monetary policy is further expected to support fall in interest rates in the domestic economy and with rebound in public capex cycle by the Government, its trickle-down effect in terms of rural and urban wages will support consumption trends in the near term. Over the long-term, the firm commitment to structural reforms aimed at widening the manufacturing footprint across identified critical sectors and further accelerating the public digital infrastructure, provides a strong comfort on continued resilience of the India story and the huge opportunities this offers to industries across sectors. The Indian coatings market is also expected to benefit from this secular growth trend in the country. Rapid urbanisation and expansive infrastructure development will fuel consumption of architectural as well as industrial coatings. With growing environmental consciousness, demand for eco-friendly coatings solutions across applications will also be on the rise. And this will further propel the efforts in research and adoption of new-age technology to bring out environmentally sustainable products and solutions. BUSINESS REVIEW Decorative business in India FY 2024-25 was a challenging year for the decorative paints industry, marked by softer growth and uneven demand patterns. Urban markets remained under pressure due to subdued consumer sentiment, shaped by persistent, albeit moderating inflation. This was reflected in downtrading trends across categories. In contrast, rural demand showed relative resilience, buoyed by a favourable monsoon and stronger agricultural output. And while the overall demand environment was challenging, the industry saw heightened competition intensity from existing as well as new players, adding pressure to overall revenue momentum. In this environment, we continued to focus on expanding the ‘bottom of the pyramid’ offerings, with Neo Bharat (latex paint reinforced with special polymer technology) and the Sparc range of products under Tractor Emulsion and Ace, enabling a stronger laddering for the consumer. This helped arrest the challenges of slow growth in the economy emulsions. The lower end emulsions basket was also supported by sub-segmentation of products to enable various offerings across finish parameters. The premium and luxury emulsions performed in line with industry growth. We have enabled sharp proposition offerings and communication that will also be strong drivers in this new financial year. All Protek, Royale Glitz, Nilaya Arc are some recent innovations and builders to the envisaged futuristic portfolios. The Creme’ finish of Royale Glitz with mechanised tools is a ‘never seen before’ offering. These have been furthered by Color Awards - a forum for top end Applicators to take these up with selling and advisory propositions. Specific unique offerings, including Dust proof proposition, a wide range of shade offerings with deep bases and our tried and tested warranty period. The waterproofing category recorded growth across interior and exterior offerings, especially the terrace applications, offering not just excellent waterproofing property but also heat resistance. Superior offering of 25-year warranty in Infinia, Décor options under Damp Proof Play and upgrade option of Damp proof Xtreme were introduced in the year. We continued to focus on expanding the ‘bottom of the pyramid’ offerings, enabling a stronger laddering for the consumer. 40 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Asian Paints Limited 41Management Discussion and Analysis  In the wood-finish category while mainlines continued the penetration across markets, the fast growth segment of PU+ was leveraged through work with Architects, Furniture manufacturers supported by Field Technologists.

The B2B team is not only present in the realty sector with paints and allied products but over the past 5 years has also created the key sub-vertical of Factories, Institutions and Corporates (FIC). In FY 2024–25, we further strengthened our capabilities with the creation of a dedicated B2G (Business-to- Government) team to capitalise on the infrastructure momentum across the country. This team is supported through technical collaborations with premier institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and other leading government research and testing bodies, along with experienced industry consultants. The year saw us establishing product leadership through innovative solutions, taking these solutions to the various clients and bodies via numerous Knowledge Leadership Initiatives with empanelled speakers across streams and stakeholders.

The FIC team has built strengths with flooring, waterproofing, metal coatings application systems among others. We have worked with leading corporates and factories across sectors including automotive, pharmaceutical, semi-conductor, data centres, chemical units and corporate offices and showrooms. In the B2G segment, significant efforts were directed toward specifications and technical validations with major focus in projects of Defence, Railways, Civil Aviation, Roads, Chemicals, Irrigation and Urban Housing. Among others, significant inroads were made across Gati-Shakti projects, bullet train and urban metro corridors, infrastructure projects in the the North-East. Product segments that enable this continuously are in the space of waterproofing solutions, corrosion resistant offerings and a wide variety of solutions that enable repairs, restoration and rehabilitation. With infrastructure development impetus across the country, our construction chemicals range has led from the front and seen tremendous success with us proudly participating in a number of landmark projects with some first in the world breakthrough products. Innovations that differentiate solutions from a product-based approach to an industry first service- based approach has seen a lot of takers given how we have addressed pain points of consumers for long- term satisfaction leading to lasting relationships.

The programme has strengthened our connect with the Architect and Interior Designer (AID) community, serving as a single point of engagement for over 5,000 AIDs across India. This direct interface has played a key role in increasing preference for our product range and reinforcing Asian Paints as a preferred full-spectrum décor solutions provider.MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS White Teak The past year saw subdued demand conditions across décor categories and this was evident in White Teak Decorative lights business as well. The adverse conditions got further amplified due to the disruption caused by the BIS challenges last year which had a huge impact in sales and servicing for all the LED products. As a result of this, the total revenue achieved in FY 2024-25 was ₹ 107 Crores as compared to ₹ 133 Crores in the previous year. However, amidst this difficult environment we have strived to ensure that White Teak has maintained and built further on its positioning of being most elevated omni-channel décor experience and the leading brand in Decorative lights in the country. We launched six stores in tier 2 cities to enhance our presence across these markets, taking the full format experience stores count to 26. Our new store in Mumbai, launched during the year, is our largest store in the country, integrating furniture and light offerings, strengthening our play in home décor. The customised design vertical, implemented in FY 2023-24, is fully functional, showing our design and execution supremacy, building strong testimonies for brand – White Teak, across customers and AIDs.For the FY 2024-25, the retail segment registered a strong revenue trajectory, with a growth of more than 50%. The B2B projects segment saw a conscious pulldown given the extremely tight pricing scenario in the market. As a result, at an overall level, revenues of ₹ 53 Crores in the current year remained flat as compared to the previous year. The successful launch of our System Aluminium range has opened new growth avenues in FY 2024-25. With a robust order book and encouraging market response, we are poised to further strengthen Asian Paints’ presence in this segment in the coming year.

The business operates in both, the full modular kitchens solution and components segment in this space. In the full modular kitchen, wardrobe, and fitted furniture space, Sleek provides design-to-execution services through a national network of dealer-owned Sleek showrooms, offering premium, contemporary, and customised solutions to cater to diverse consumer preferences and project requirements.

In the components business we distribute a comprehensive range of kitchen hardware, accessories, appliances, wardrobe fitting and other hardware through 100+ distributors to over 4,000+ retailers pan-India.Business performance Sleek modular business had a healthy growth in the fiscal year. Luxury kitchens and wardrobes continued to contribute more than 35% of the value, reflecting Sleek’s brand positioning as the preferred premium brand by customers and architects. A milestone achievement for Sleek this year was expanding manufacturing capabilities to inaugurate a new plant in Wada, Maharashtra, with a built-up area of 72,000 sq ft and a modular production capacity of 2.1 Lakhs sq ft per month. To achieve an enhanced design-to- manufacture journey, Sleek launched Dezigno, an in-house digital platform that offers seamless integration between consumer preferences, design visualisation, and factory execution.

Sleek has also significantly enhanced its last-mile installation with over 150 trained carpenter teams overseen by supervisors and equipped with advanced tools.As part of product development, Sleek launched Guardian cabinets, an innovative kitchen cabinetry solution that provides complete protection against any water leakages and termite infestations. It also introduced pre-laminated shades, a curated palette of finishes catering to the ever-evolving customer aesthetic. With inter-functional collaboration and continuous efforts, Sleek has serviced over 5,000 architect sites during the year and aims to significantly expand this collaborative effort in the coming year. During FY 2024-25, the components segment witnessed muted demand environment and there was some amount of uncertainty due to announcements of Anti- Dumping Duty and BIS certification requirements in core category products. This resulted in a price revision action for imported products while simultaneously working to develop domestic vendors before the BIS implementation dates. We had an increased focus on India sourcing to derisk from the same in the future in other categories.MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS and government-led housing schemes provided a stable foundation, the year proved challenging for the industry due to inflationary pressures, project delays in real estate, and a more cautious consumer mindset. Premium and branded categories experienced a slowdown, while demand remained more resilient in the mid to economy segments, particularly among regional and value-focused players. The business recorded revenues of ₹ 356 Crores during the year, leveraging the network and product expansion initiatives undertaken. We maintained a strong focus on expanding both premium and economy portfolio. Our products under Bathsense CANVAS, a differentiated offering with a superior in-house developed coating provides a 25-year warranty with its unique Lotus-25 hydrophobic technology, continue to receive positive feedback from architects and top-end channel partners. Canvas Play, a concept that allows architects to mix and match different colour combinations on our faucets basis their design preferences, was also launched in the latter part of the year and was well received. During the year, Bathsense introduced top-end 5 Way Neocontrol+ thermostat products supporting the technical superiority of the product offerings and attractively positioned Bathsense in the market as a partner of choice. The business also launched new ranges in EssEss, which offers competitively priced products in value for money segment. PuraShield was another coatings led solution developed inhouse by Asian Paints R&T to provide a comprehensive solution to TDS and hard water related issues on faucet aesthetics. Plumber training and knowledge development continued to be focal points during the year, and these were driven by accreditation- led programmes. Our commitment to strong after-sales service standards remains a significant factor that sets us apart in both project-based and retail channels. We continued to leverage the strengths of the Asian Paints group across technology, retail network with beautiful homes, the architect community and synergy with projects to make further inroads in the bath industry.Our efforts in new products introduction in the recent years continued to yield results with overall contributions increasing to 25% of sale.

ASIANPAINT_4_5,Asian Paints Ltd,ASIANPAINT,Paints,2024,pdf,"Although long-term enablers such as urban development, sanitation awareness, 48 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Asian Paints Limited 49Management Discussion and Analysis  Supply chain From the supply chain perspective, the year presented a very dynamic set of challenges. After a period of relative stability in upstream supply flows, the early part of the year witnessed some disruptions, followed by container shortages towards the close of the year. Despite these pressures, commodity prices remained largely subdued, aided by the global economic slowdown. However, the introduction of US tariffs and reciprocal trade actions later in the year dampened trade sentiment and exerted deflationary pressure on input costs. In this context, our integrated supply chain approach that spans sourcing, procurement, backward integration, manufacturing, logistics, manufacturing technology, sustainability and joint value creation provided the strategic and tactical lever that ensured that we were able to offer differentiated products as well as opportunities to delight our customers together with our commitment to service excellence. With the demand conditions being quite dynamic, it was critical to enhance our next generation planning and execution engine to continue to deliver our world- class same-day order fulfilment benchmarks. This year, we scaled up our new Raw Material Procurement Planning solution MPX, which took an integrated view of the entire network to optimise the procurement cost while ensuring vendor share. It goes beyond traditional planning, capturing decades of purchasing expertise, optimising vendor shares, material alternates and country- wide inventories. Tailored for Asian Paints, MPX delivers significant cost efficiencies while enhancing production and storage synergies across facilities.By enabling faster, integrated procurement planning, it allows our teams to focus more on strategic collaboration. MPX also drives our backward integration initiatives, strengthening self-sufficiency. Today, this engine stands as a strategic backbone by minimising costs, boosting supply chain agility and ultimately enabling us to serve customers better. Further, our foray into multiple product categories only intensified this year and the supply chain continued to support the launch of a plethora of innovative products with agility and expand the segmented supply chain. Our focus was also on maintaining optimum working capital despite the complex demand conditions. We adopt a comprehensive stage- gate process to assess and onboard potential suppliers across multiple parameters, including quality, delivery, price competitiveness and legal compliance. The evaluation also critically examines ESG factors, such as environmental policies, management system implementation and self-declarations on human rights practices. Our efforts to cocreate value with raw material suppliers has yielded strong results this year as have our efforts to drive value and sustainability in the space of packaging. We continued to work on bringing in sourcing and formulation savings. We continued to ride the wave of evolving changes in India’s logistics sector to optimise our cost and carbon footprint. This year, we worked with our partners to set up dedicated fleets to unlock greater opportunities both in costs and in service. Frequent demand sensing, powered by machine learning is enhancing inventory management and minimising stockouts, thereby improving order fill rates. All these efforts will continue to give us strong competitive advantage in the medium term. During the year, our factories continued on the maturity curve of the manufacturing excellence programme that saw strong engagement from our shop floor teams. This year, we drove more than 8,300 Kaizens and 260+ Blitz and Profit Improvement projects, thus creating a substantial measured value on the ground. Under the Vyansamadhanam initiative, we continued to demonstrate our sincere commitment towards the safety and well-being of our people and operations. This year, six of our plants have achieved the ‘Generative Stage’ in Behaviour Based Safety (BBS) and remaining two plants are in the ‘Proactive Stage’. The drive towards road safety expanded to the larger organisation. We also took great strides in the domain of process safety through targeted investments in barriers and leveraging technology for proactive and reliable detection of process safety incidents and escalation in case of deviations. This year we commissioned our expansions in Mysuru and Ankleshwar facilities. The Mysuru factory is now a 6 Lakh KL per annum facility – making it the largest paint factory in the world. The Ankleshwar facility is an engineering marvel where we have built both flexibility and scale within the existing space. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS International business Asian Paints operates in 13 countries across four key regions: South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and the South Pacific. Our global portfolio is marketed under seven established corporate brands — Asian Paints, SCIB Paints, Apco Coatings, Asian Paints Berger, Taubmans, Asian Paints Causeway and Kadisco Asian Paints. increases were taken in Ethiopia and Bangladesh market to protect margins. Operating costs have been under tremendous pressure across these markets due to high inflationary environment. Supply chain bottlenecks also continued intermittently across many subsidiaries due to geopolitical issues. The year was also characterised by unprecedented events in many geographies, where we operate. Bangladesh was witness to political events in August 2024 which had an impact on the overall economic scenario in the country in that period. This period also saw disruption in operations and an impact on consumer demand. At the same time, the unit was able to get back to normalising operations, and spring back into regular transactions quickly. Bangladeshi Taka remained under pressure throughout the year and the availability of US Dollar has been scarce, leading to issues in raw material supplies. Operations in South Pacific were also impacted by the strong earthquake in Vanuatu in December 2024, which disrupted normal life and cut off communication and logistics routes for a while. Our teams in the South Pacific were able to restore operations in January 2025 and have been working with the community there to build back housing and infrastructure. The Egyptian Pound broadly remained stable in FY 2024-25 after a depreciation of nearly 53% in March 2024, following a 66% currency depreciation in FY 2022-23. With IMF support and government reforms, overall macroeconomic sentiment improved, and construction activity remained robust, driving steady demand in the coatings market. Construction activity and demand for housing continued at a strong pace in Egypt.Ethiopia, which has been experiencing US dollar shortages for many years now, witnessed a massive currency devaluation. While such a massive devaluation led to initial operational disturbances, availability of USD has improved thereafter and is expected to further improve. Business performance Across regions, focused operational interventions helped mitigate the impact of currency depreciation and inflationary headwinds. All subsidiaries undertook rigorous initiatives to enhance operational efficiency, optimise working capital, and preserve liquidity, which proved essential in managing volatility in Egypt, Ethiopia and Bangladesh. Prices were increased wherever necessitated by the inflation in raw material and packing material. At the same time, a series of initiatives across the Middle East, Egypt and South Asia units to connect with consumers through powerful product and service propositions has provided for a stronger business foundation for the future.",7820,5,9,https://www.asianpaints.com/content/dam/asianpaints/website/secondary-navigation/investors/annual-reports/2024-2025/Integrated-Annual-Report-FY_2024-25.pdf,https://www.asianpaints.com/more/investors.html,2025-08-01T17:58:36.988219,,,

Growth in premium- luxury products played a pivotal role and enabled deeper shop-shares in existing critical and competitive retailers. We also continued our focus on product value propositions and worked on launching/revamping products across markets, ensuring better quality and comprehensive offerings to consumers. Décor and painting solutions offered under the umbrella of Safe Painting Solutions have been well-appreciated, revolutionised customer experiences and have helped us create a strong differentiator vis-à-vis competition. Operating environment Raw material prices remained benign for most part of the year, with a minor deflationary trend. This allowed most markets to operate at stable prices throughout the year and allowed all subsidiaries to focus on developing their business activities.

Aggressive network reach work was carried out across geographies through marketing campaigns, dynamic servicing and focus on specific product categories. The Aquasafe Exterior Waterproofing Paint has been able to win over consumers across the country with its strong performance both on superior whiteness and protection from rain in the value segments. Growth journey in Indonesia remained tough with a very slow scale-up and pressure on profitability and cashflows due to sub-scale operations. We evaluated all possibilities and took the step of exiting the market in March 2025 through divestment. Africa The Egyptian market remained uncertain and volatile with significant devaluation of currency leading to high inflation, dip in consumer demand and changing priorities of the customers. We took extensive measures to tackle uncertainty and competition post devaluation. The Painter Loyalty Programme – Masterstrokes – continued to increase in both the number of active members as well as the number of transactions. Beautiful Homes Painting Service also continued to do well, providing access to a large number of consumers across the country. Cost reduction initiatives were also undertaken across all areas to ensure lesser dent on profitability. In Ethiopia, civil unrest continued in parts of the country creating supply chain bottlenecks. Massive devaluation took place during the year leading to significant forex fluctuation losses and impacting the profitability. However, we took sufficient measures in forex management, product pricing and sourcing leading to a better than expected performance. Middle East The Middle East region has been a strong contributor in overall success of international operations, untouched by the currency issues. Deflationary environment and strong investments in housing projects aided overall business prospects for the region. The highlight of business performance was the series of extensive efforts initiated to connect with the Arabic consumer at the time of Eid, with the powerful idea of ‘Little MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Asia (South Asia and Indonesia) Nepal has made a steady recovery in the areas of liquidity, new construction and overall market situation.

All these measures ensured a good recovery, increasing the number of actively transacting dealers through the year.

Saudi Aramco plant at Hazira, GujaratDécor ideas store in Muscat, Oman 52 Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Asian Paints Limited 53Management Discussion and Analysis  Non-auto industrial coatings AP-PPG, the second 50:50 JV of our Company with PPG Industries Inc., USA, serves the non-automotive industrial coatings market of India and operates in the protective coatings, powder coatings and traffic solutions segments, catering to clients in infrastructure, energy, oil & gas, construction, machinery and equipments, domestic appliances sectors, amongst others. Operating environment The growth momentum of the Indian economy waned a bit in the year, especially in the first half of the FY 2024-25. Investment in infrastructure sector slowed down measurably in this period and private investments remained sporadic. Shortage of skilled labour, particularly in the first half of the year, impacted the execution of projects. And while the demand conditions picked up in the second half, it was an overall subdued environment for the year amidst slowing down of formal sector wages and tightening of consumption lending norms. Weak demand and persistent liquidity challenges coupled with intensified competition saddled with surplus capacity meant that the industry experienced a spell of extremely competitive pricing putting pressure on growth and margins. Nevertheless, the continued impetus of the government in infrastructure creation and the budgetary measures to reduce the tax burden are expected to provide support to a pick-up in demand conditions as we progress into the new financial year. Business performance AP-PPG delivered double-digit volume growth in a challenging year. The Company’s focus on dealer network expansion, enhancement of product portfolio in its pioneering industrial tinting system and OEM relationships fuelled the growth engine. The Company took up multiple initiatives to elevate its customer experience by further expanding the partner loyalty programmes and digitalisation initiatives. To serve its customers better, the Company embarked upon its largest-ever capacity expansion programme which will increase its in- house capacity by 60%. AP-PPG benefitted immensely from the collaboration with its parent companies – Asian Paints and PPG Industries Inc., USA in securing orders from public sector and international projects. The Company remains committed to continuously enhance the value proposition for its customers leveraging the technological expertise of its parents. Its unique asset integrity management service – Metacare – continued to gain traction with major PSUs entering into supply and apply contracts in Protective Coatings. The Company’s Traffic Solutions segment registered healthy growth despite the slowdown in highway construction during the year. Powder Coatings business continued to enhance its presence in OEM segments – Appliances and Two- wheelers – on the back of innovative technology offering and superior technical service. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Business performance PPG-AP registered single digit growth in terms of sales and maintained strong profitability during the year. The year witnessed stable raw material pricing, though challenged by adverse currency fluctuations in the latter half of the year. Innovation in formulations and focus on driving operational efficiency helped to retain the profitability for the business. PPG-AP continued to make further progress in leveraging the technological expertise from its parents, PPG Industries Inc., USA and Asian Paints to provide technologically superior solutions and enhance the value proposition for its customers.

This outlook is further reinforced by our consistent track record of strong operational execution demonstrated over the last several years. Now, I would request Shiv to walk you through more details on the numbers. Shiv Walia: Thank you, CVK . Good morning, good afternoon , and good evening to all of you. Thank you for joining our Q1 FY26 earnings call. Let me walk you through our financial performance for the quarter . Starting with the revenue performance : Total revenue for the quarter is $3,545 million, a 0.8% decline quarter on quarter and a growth of 3.7% year -on-year in constant currency terms. With this, our revenue has crossed the milestone of LTM revenue of $14 billion. Services revenue for the quarter came in at $3,227 million, which is a decline of 0.1% quarter -on-quarter , and a growth of 4.5% year -on-year in constant currency terms. The strength of our all -weather portfolio helped us offset the  HCLTech July 14, 2025 headwinds from the usual Q1 seasonality. Software revenue for the quarter is $330 million, a drop of 3% year -on-year in constant currency terms. Let me share the details on profitability now : Our EBIT is $578 million at 16.3% of revenue. The net income for the quarter is $440 million at 12.7% of revenue . This quarter, we traded short -term pain in profitability to secure our long -term growth leadership. Q1 margins usually have a negative impact due to seasonality for us. This time, it was amplified due to 3 factors that CVK just called out. It is important to note that we did not cut back on our investments in sales, Gen AI and people capacity to secure growth. Now, on the margin bridge explaining the same : The Company margins dropped by 161 basis points quarter -on-quarter. The higher sales and marketing investment had 30 basis points impact. Lower utilization due to specialized hiring and skill and location mismatch challenges cost us 80 basis points. One -off impacts during this quarter, which include a client bankruptcy had 30 basis point impact. Other major factors such as lower share of software in the revenue mix had 20 basis point impact. We did not get any benefit from the forex this quarter. Project Ascend is on track and was instrumental in helping negate the impact of increased average resource cost. Now, moving on to Return on Invested Capital , which is ROIC: Our ROIC continues to improve. Thanks to our ongoing focus on profitability and efficient capital management. The last 12 months ROIC is at 38.1% for the Company up 353 basis points year -on-year and services ROIC now is at 45.2% up 236 basis points year -on-year. The software continued to improve with ROIC at 20.8% up 473 basis points year -on-year. Let me share the details on our strong cash generation:  HCLTech July 14, 2025 Over the last 12 months, operating cash flow is at $2.57 billion, while free cash flow amounted to $2.42 billion. Operating cash flow to net income conversion is 129% and free cash flow to net income is 121%.

Message from the Chairman Anand G Mahindra Chairman, Mahindra Group 16 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25  Tectonic shifts – brought about by AI, by climate change, by geopolitics – appear to be marking the end of one age, and the uncertain dawn of another. It’s almost as if some unseen force is wielding a giant kaleidoscope, where it only takes a slight twist of the lens for a pattern to disappear and re-emerge in a new and unfamiliar form. Each twist of global events – geopolitical realignments, policy reversals, economic realignments, regional hostilities – reshapes the view. Patterns that once seemed clear now rearrange themselves almost daily. What appeared to be fixed just a year ago has fractured into fragments, realigning into new configurations. The immediate trigger for this situation is the change of direction in the US. The sudden pivot to protectionism is churning the waters of the established trade order. Moves and countermoves are changing the pattern, literally every day. Uncertainty and lack of trust and confidence are affecting everything from high level global alliances to the price of children’s toys. Countries whose economies were shaped by global trade networks are rethinking their alliances and cutting down on their dependencies. Though there appears to be some softening of US-China positions lately, this could be temporary, and grave uncertainties remain. Businesses will also be forced to rethink their strategies and partnerships. However, periods of chaos offer unique opportunities to rethink and rebuild. The map is being redrawn daily and it is up to us to redraw some of it to our advantage. The old order is changing, yielding place to the new. The dominance of the US in capital markets and China in supply chains has been shaken. The new order embracing more economic self-interest, and redrawn trade relationships, will lead to new alliances, new partnerships. Regional and bilateral agreements will take on a new life. The recent FTA between India and the UK, which has been very ably negotiated by both sides, is a signpost to the future. It gives a heartening fillip to the services sector in India and will accelerate the IT industry’s global growth momentum. I am confident it will act as a catalyst, driving efficiency, enabling innovation and opening new pathways for global competitiveness, to the benefit of companies like yours. As bilateralism grows in importance, India will have increasing relevance. Many countries will be looking for new partners, and India fits the bill in so many ways. We offer size and scale. We are seen as relatively neutral in world affairs. We offer a democratic government, political stability, a youthful population and a growing economy. We have a large domestic market which can attract new players. We offer trust and reliability as both a multilateral and a bilateral partner. And I am optimistic we can ride out the problems on our border without affecting our upward economic trajectory. The map is being redrawn daily and it is up to us to redraw some of it to our advantage. The old order is changing, yielding place to the new. 17 CORPORATE OVERVIEW  The kaleidoscope, however, will continue to turn in the foreseeable future. TechM has 2 great strengths in this shifting scenario. The first is its history of being a trusted and reliable partner. In the current trade wars, the first casualty has been trust. Long-standing relationships between countries, long-standing political and military commitments have been suddenly upended. Trust and reliability have taken a beating. The eminent social scientist Francis Fukuyama has long argued that trust is a fundamental element for economic prosperity and business success. A culture of trust enhances cooperation and collaboration and reduces the need for costly legal enforcement and bureaucratic control with their attendant, (and draining) transaction costs. That is why “high trust societies” are better at building large, efficient organisations – especially businesses. In the current kaleidoscopic world, trust is a guarantee that shared values will continue to drive a relationship. TechM has earned that trust in spades. Indeed, it owes its very birth to a trust- based partnership with British Telecom in 1986. Since then, it has built a reputation for trustworthiness over the decades, through strategic relationships and partnerships that emphasise long- term trust, technological collaboration and customer-centric delivery. Many of its client relationships span 10 to 20 plus years particularly in telecom, BFSI and manufacturing and TechM has supported those clients through business cycles. It has enjoyed long standing partnerships with companies like Microsoft, Google Cloud and Cisco. I remember when TechM acquired Satyam Computer Services in 2009, I personally visited every major erstwhile Satyam client to reassure them of our values and our abilities. It is a testament to the power of TechM’s reputation for being both capable and trustworthy, the overwhelming majority of clients did not switch to another IT partner, in spite of Satyam’s (then) tainted status. If trust was important then, it is even more important now.
