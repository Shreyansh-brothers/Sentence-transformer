Our revenue declined by {revenue_decline}% to ₹{revenue} crores, primarily due to reduced demand and pricing pressures across key segments. The company faced severe margin compression as input costs escalated while pricing power remained constrained. Operating expenses increased by {opex_increase}% despite cost optimization initiatives, reflecting the challenging business environment.

We reported a net loss of ₹{net_loss} crores compared to a profit of ₹{prev_profit} crores in the previous year. The deterioration in profitability was primarily attributable to lower volumes, increased provisioning requirements, and one-time charges related to restructuring activities. Cash flow from operations turned negative at ₹{negative_cash_flow} crores, necessitating additional borrowings to meet working capital requirements.

The regulatory environment has become increasingly complex, with new compliance requirements adding to our operational burden. Several ongoing investigations and legal proceedings have created uncertainty about potential future liabilities.

The recurrent waves of Covid-19 pandemic continued to affect business activities. Economic recovery , after the second and third waves of the Covid-19 pandemic in India, was fairly subdued due to rising inflation, supply side constraints, currency and commodity volatility and unforeseen geo-political tensions. Dealing with rising input costs in a low demand environment was the critical challenge confronting businesses during the year. The severity of the inflation in essential inputs like refined palm oil and crude oil was a source of particular concern for the Food Industry . Just as these challenges were being addressed, the Russia-Ukraine crisis resulted in a further aggravation of inflationary tendencies across the board, resulting in price increases and concerns over availability of commodities like wheat and sugar which form the core inputs for the food industry . Despite these challenges, your Company was able to ensure consistent growth by creating and sustaining an ecosystem of efficiencies through planned cost efficiency programs, innovations, IT transformation, process improvements and supply chain management. The importance of adopting sustainable practices has acquired greater urgency for businesses due to the pace of environmental, social and economic developments. As a responsible corporate citizen, your Company has also undertaken major initiatives to integrate sustainability into all aspects of its business. BAKERY BUSINESS Biscuit Biscuits is the largest category in the food business in India. It is present in the consumption basket of virtually every Indian family as an essential product. It is one of the most deeply penetrated categories in the country , reaching over 90 of the households. However, the per capita consumption of biscuits in India is relatively low at 2 kgs versus 10 kgs in certain developed countries. The low per capita consumption and high levels of penetration continue to provide excellent opportunities to increase consumption through proactive interventions and strategies. Cake Cake is a category in which product innovation at affordable price points has accele rated, thereby leading to intense competition. The category growth has been affected due to school closures on account of the pandemic, decline in out of home consumption and sluggish economic conditions. Rusk Rusk as a category witnessed significant growth on account of prolonged lockdowns and rise of in- home consumption. However, the demand has now stabilized. Product innovation in this category in India remains low and offers significant opportunity for disruption with new value added offerings. Bread Bread is considered as a staple food in many parts of India. With increasing consumer preference for healthy and value added products, this category provides significant opportunities for established players and new entrants. DAIRY BUSINESS India is ranked No.1 in milk production and currently contributes 23 of global milk production. Organized dairy segment, which constitutes about 26-30 of the Indian dairy industry (by value) has seen faster growth compared to the unorganized segment. The organized dairy industry is likely to witness 12 revenue growth this financial year to reach  1.6 lakh Crore, mainly due to recovery in demand for value-added products, steady liquid milk sales and a hike in the retail price. While packaged liquid milk will remain a key driver of the industry growth, value added dairy products are also expected to witness healthy growth. ADJACENT BUSINESS Cream Wafers Wafers is a   750 Crore category which is growing at a healthy pace year-on-year. Your Company is one of the pioneering brands to enter this space. The category is highly unorganized and fragmented. This presents your Company with an opportunity for leveraging the strengths of nationwide presence and innovation to rapidly grow in this category . 46 Corporate Overview  Statutory Reports  ",4103.0,620.0,14.524711718693604,21.221090679583696,3.0,1.0,1,4.0,3.0,2.0,yes,,"""consistent growth by creating and sustaining an ecosystem of efficiencies""

By the year 2023, global spending is expected to exceed 1.5 trillion. (IQVIA Institute forecast, January 2019). Global growth of medicine spending through 2023 will primarily be driven by developed markets and their adoption of a wave of newly launched innovative products. Growth in the United States will be driven by new products and pricing adjustments. Global growth will be driven by expanded access and use of medicines in pharmerging markets with demographic growth, affordability and government spending. Pharmerging market growth continues to derive primarily from increasing per capita use due to increasing urbanization and growing middle class, but some markets are seeing wider uptake of newer medicines as patients ability to afford their share of costs improves with economic growth. Research and development pipelines are growing while success rates are continuing at historic levels and may result in more new product launches in the next five years.

The Covid-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption in global economic activity, reflected in severely weakened macro-economic indicators. Global GDP numbers are being revised depending upon stimulus packages initiated by respective governments and central banks, and the recovery potential of economies through the pandemic. All these will lead to significant volatility in the near to medium term across key economic indicators, including currency, liquidity and inflation. Despite the perceived immunity of the pharmaceutical sector, the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to cause major shifts in chronic and acute drug usage and healthcare delivery in developed and developing markets, impacting the operations of pharmaceutical companies across the globe. Since March 2020, most governments worldwide have accelerated containment measures to restrict the spread of the virus and utilise healthcare infrastructure and resources for Covid-19 treatment. This translates into fluctuating demand for medicines in hospital channels due to restricted patient flow for routine ailments (OPD) and rescheduling of non-critical surgeries. Restricted patient visits are likely to adversely impact prescriptions and medication refills, field force engagement, new product launches and inventory levels in the distribution channel, depending upon the duration and the severity of the pandemic. The pandemic may also cause interruptions in the procurement of raw material supplies, manufacturing operations and therefore the supply of medicines as the Company ensures the safety and well-being of its employees and stakeholders. The above factors have created an environment of significant uncertainty, which limits the ability of the company to make appropriate projections about business trajectory in the coming year(s). Evolving demand patterns can also have an impact on financial health as we extend liquidity support to our channel partners and suppliers. Cipla is taking proactive measures to manage the crisis and adapt to new realities to ensure sustainability of its procurement, manufacturing and distribution, and deliver on its strategic goals. Overview Ciplas relentless commitment and contribution over the last 85 years towards improving healthcare outcomes and standards of care has positively impacted the lives of patients in more than 80 countries globally. Our purpose of Caring for Life enables us to deliver unmatched capabilities across the care continuum in various therapeutic areas, including the widest range of drug-device combinations and cementing our position as a lung leader in India and other key emerging markets. Our RD engine and manufacturing operations are well-positioned to unlock opportunities emerging from the evolving healthcare ecosystem, and deliver superior value to patients, shareholders and all other stakeholders. 1GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3 Management Discussion and Analysis 121Corporate Overview 001-120Statutory Reports 121-230Financial Statements 231-423 Caring For Life since 1935 120Annual Report 2019-20 Evolving regulatory framework across key markets3 Regulatory developments and government initiatives in India During the year, the Indian regulatory authorities announced several initiatives around generics, APIs and clinical trials. The government continues the focus on revising and updating the National List of Essential Medicines Expansion of Jan Aushadhi stores offering affordable medicines continues to provide price competition to pharmaceutical companies. The Ayushman Bharat programme, the worlds largest state sponsored health insurance scheme, will continue to drive access to healthcare services in the country, and can potentially trigger a rise in demand. Introduction of telemedicine guidelines led to the formal recognition of this practice in India, legally. This is expected to improve patient convenience as consultations can be done remotely through any form of communication media. The Union Cabinet has proposed schemes with an allocation of approximately H10,000 crores towards construction of bulk drug parks, incentives to boost domestic output and reducing dependency on imports. The government has also identified 53 APIs that it would like domestic drug companies to focus on. From a manufacturing perspective, implementation timelines of such schemes and timely product approvals will be key to reduce dependency on imports over the medium to long term. E-pharmacies, entering into their fifth year of existence, will continue to evolve their business models to integrate into the overall healthcare ecosystem.

INTEGRATED REPORT The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in their circular dated 6 February, 2017, has advised the top 500 listed companies (by market capitalisation) to voluntarily adopt Integrated Reporting (IR) from FY 2017-18. The Company believes in sustainable value creation while balancing utilisation of natural resources and social development in its business decisions. We had prepared our 1st Integrated Report for the period ended 31 March, 2018. The Company has been recognised with the Highly Commended award for Asias Best Integrated Report category at the 4th Asia Sustainability Reporting Awards (ASRA) concluded in Singapore. ASRA is the highest recognition for corporate reporting in the region. In continuation with this commitment the Company is delighted to present the second Integrated Report for the period ended 31 March, 2019. The IR framework of the Company has been developed on the Guiding Principles and Content Elements as defined by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). IR is a concept that better articulates the broader range of measures that contribute to an organisations long-term value creation. Central to this concept is the proposition that value is increasingly shaped by factors additional to financial performance, such as reliance on the environment, social reputation, human capital, innovation and others. This value creation concept is the backbone of IR and is the direction for future of corporate reporting. In addition to the financial capital, this format of reporting examines five additional capitals that should guide an organisations decision-making and long-term value creation. This report articulates the Companys unique approach to long term value creation which is a paradigm shift from the traditional financial reporting to governance based value creation model. 7. PROJECTS AND EXPANSION PLANS As per JPC data, India produced around 107 MTPA of crude steel in FY 2018-19 and the cumulative steel consumption was about 97.5 MTPA. As Indias GDP is expected to grow by 7 to 8 , steel consumption is expected to remain strong. The current high capacity utilisation, consolidation of players in flat segment and expected robust domestic demand augurs well for the steel industry. Government of India has declared a New Steel Policy to increase steel production capacity to about 300 MTPA steel by 2030, considering the per capita consumption increasing to 160 kgs and elasticity of steel demand at 1.14 upto 2020 and thereafter at 1. In light of the above, there is an opportunity for the Company to participate in the strong India growth story by exploring various organic and inorganic opportunity. With a strategic objective of augmenting the incremental capacity creation at a low specific investment cost so that they remain returns accretive, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved certain key projects. The major projects cumulatively approved are: (a) Upstream Projects  Augmenting crude steel capacity at Vijayanagar  Dolvi 1) In Vijayanagar, the capacity upgradation project of Blast Furnace-3 from 3.0 MTPA to 4.5 MTPA, along with the associated auxiliary units is under implementation. With a view to leverage the additional capacity being built, a new 160T Zero Power Furnace and 1 x 1.4 MTPA Billet Caster along with associated facilities will be installed at SMS-3 to enhance steelmaking capacity. Further, installation of a new Wire Rod Mill No.2 of 1.2 MTPA capacity to enhance overall plant capacity is under implementation. The above facilities would augment the steel- making capacity to 13 MTPA. 10 A VISION TO EXECUTE BETTER. EVERYDAY.DIRECTORS REPORT (CONTD) 2) The expansion project at Dolvi from 5 MTPA to 10 MTPA is currently under implementation. The major facilities included in the project are 4.5 MTPA Blast furnace with a 5 MTPA Steel Melt Shop, a 5 MTPA Hot Strip Mill, a 5.75 MTPA sinter plant, 4 MTPA pellet plant and 4 kilns of 600 TPD LCPs. Post completion of both these projects, the Companys overall crude steel making capacity is expected to increase from 18 MTPA to 24 MTPA by March 2020 (b) Enriching product mix With a strategic focus on enriching its product mix, the Company has decided to increase the volume and share of value added and special products in its portfolio. Considering the growth potential in these value added segments, the Company has decided to set up the following downstream facilities: 1) Setting up 0.3 MTPA colour coated line at CRM1 complex at Vijayanagar 2) Modernisation and Capacity Enhancement at Vasind  Tarapur by 1.5 MTPA by setting up PLTCM 3) Capacity expansion of CRM-1 complex from 0.85 MTPA to 1.80 MTPA at Vijayanagar 4) Addition of a new 1.2 MTPA Continuous Pickling Line for HRPO products, two new lines of 0.45 MTPA each for Construction grade galvanised products 5) Installation of an additional ",5000.0,793.0,14.019482910767238,29.458761811147053,1.0,3.0,2,4.0,4.0,2.0,yes,,"“delighted to present the second Integrated Report”

“expected to increase from 18 MTPA to 24 MTPA by March 2020”

","“...relies on natural resources and social development in its business decisions.”

While this is framed positively, it subtly acknowledges dependency on finite environmental and social inputs, which could be seen as a risk in the context of sustainability.

“...increasing steel production capacity to about 300 MTPA... considering the per capita consumption increasing...”

Implies high capital intensity and dependency on strong future demand, which could pose a downside risk if growth falters.

“...high capacity utilisation, consolidation of players...”

Suggests the industry may be nearing saturation or consolidation phase, which can signal competitive pressure or limited future upside.

“...exploring various organic and inorganic opportunities.”

This vague phrase implies the lack of a clearly defined growth path, suggesting uncertainty in strategy execution.","Recognition and leadership in integrated/sustainable reporting

The following year, to present our shareholders with a more holistic view of how we create and sustain long-term value, we included key elements of the Integrated Report (IR) along with the Annual Report. While staying true to the principles of the International Integrated ANNOUNCEMENT Reporting Councils framework that was incorporated in the past, this year our Integrated Report structure has evolved to create a m ore reader-friendly experience. This IR is in consonance with SEBIs circular dated 6th February 2017. An Integrated Report takes corporate reporting beyond just discussing the ﬁnancial resources, as any value creation activity requires other resources like people, natural resources and business relationships. This report will discuss how Mahindra  M ahindra Ltd. creates value by leveraging the interlinkages between these interdependent resources. Where necessary, we have explained the concept using charts and infographics. Some IR related data might be management estimates and could be updated in subsequent publications, like the Mahindra Sustainability Report.03 31 46 47 20506 20 27 03MAHINDRA  MAHINDRA LTD. INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19 Businesses exist to create value for their diverse stakeholders. Today, businesses depend on more than just ﬁnancial capital or plant and machinery to create this value. Employees and the environment are signiﬁcant factors, as are governance and the relationship with vendors, suppliers, the community in which businesses operate, and the society at large. A b usinesss ability to sustain value over the long-term depends on how it manages, utilises and integrates all these tangible and intangible resources. This Integrated Report begins with an overview of the business and its ethos, and then elaborates on how the business sustains value using a robust governance framework. It also explains in detail how the pursuit of excellence fuels strategy, mitigates risks, and ampliﬁes opportunities for the business. HOW TO READ THIS REPORT We also use an easy-to-understand diagram to depict inputs, outputs and outcomes, that is measured by KPIs. The report structure this year remains true to the principles of integrated reporting and seeks to create a m ore lucid ﬂow of information for a crisp and coherent disclosure. The detailed Statutory Statements and Financial Reports are also part of this document and are in line with the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013 (including the rules made thereunder), Indian Accounting Standards, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and the applicable Secretarial Standards. The reporting period of Mahindra  Mahindra Ltd. for this Integrated Report is 1st April, 2018 to 31st March, 2019. It provides an overview of the operations and business development activities of the Company. This Integrated Report is also aligned to the nine principles of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs National Voluntary Guidelines (NVG) on the social, environmental and economic responsibilities of a b usiness.Scope of the Report The scope of this Integrated Report is restricted to the domestic business of Mahindra  M ahindra Limited and Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Limited, consisting of the Automotive Sector, Farm Equipment Sector, Spares Business Unit, Mahindra Research Valley, Two-Wheeler Division, Construction Equipment Division and Powertrain Business Division.

We have also shown the data related to other group businesses and companies, wherever required, to provide a h olistic view of the companys performance and presence.Taking a broader view, Integrated Reporting covers not only the nancial health of an organisation, but also considers factors such as innovation that enhances our way of life, environment that impacts our planet, and society that determines our license to operate.Integrated Report IR 04 COMP ANY OVERVIEW DRIVEN BY EXCELLE NCE BUILD ING FOR THE FUTU RE FOCU SSED ON SUSTAINAB ILITY CORPORA TE INFORMA TION STATUTO RY REPORTS FINANC IAL STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS FINANCIAL (MM  MVML) Net Sales  Operating Income Grew by 11.1 to 52,848 crore in F19 compared to L 47,577 crore in F18  Top-line crossed 50,000 crore mark for the rst time EBITDA Grew by 6.9 ",5000.0,749.0,10.397717501016473,1.9160855357806348,9.0,9.0,1,4.0,3.5,2.5,yes,,"“Integrated Report takes corporate reporting beyond just discussing financial resources”, “create and sustain long-term value”, “commitment towards transparency and the highest standards of corporate governance”, “value creation activity”, “pursuit of excellence fuels strategy”, “mitigates risks”, “amplifies opportunities”, “reader-friendly experience”, “robust governance framework”, “measured by KPIs”, “driven by excellence”","“some IR related data might be management estimates and could be updated” (minor caution), “restricted to the domestic business” (limitation in scope), “structure has evolved” (implies previous shortcomings, though not framed negatively)","Integrated Reporting, Value Creation, Stakeholder Engagement, Transparency & Governance, Long-term Strategy, ESG Alignment, Business Model Explanation, Non-Financial Capitals, Risk Mitigation, Sustainable Development","The report highlights Mahindra’s maturity in adopting Integrated Reporting aligned with SEBI and IIRC principles.

FY19-20 plans will continue the journey of reducing dependence on Middle East markets and continue with investments in newer consumer bases (locals, across Middle East), markets (US, EU) and channels (e-commerce).3. DIvIDEND The Directors are pleased to recommend the payment of dividend on equity shares at the rate of 500 (i.e. D 5 per equity share of D 1 each), subject to approval by the shareholders at the ensuing Annual General Meeting (AGM). 4. TRANSFER TO GENERAL RESER vE The Board of Directors has decided to retain the entire amount of profits for FY 2018-19 in the Retained Earnings. 5. FINANCE Excellent top line growth and good working capital management helped the Company generate significantly higher levels of cash in the financial year. This resulted in substantially higher interest and other income from the surplus cash generated. However, as part of the treasury operations which were in line with the Investment Policy approved by the Board, the Company during the year had also invested D 145 crore in the 6 month inter corporate deposits with the ILFS Group based on the high credit ratings assigned to them and assessment of risk profile at the time of investing. Unfortunately, the financial distress of the ILFS Group was made evident after credit rating agencies downgraded the ratings to default status from the AAA they had assigned earlier when the Company had invested. The Company has therefore, as a measure of prudence, fully provided for this investment. The Company has also revisited its Investment Policy and created an Investment Committee of the Board to monitor investments going forward. The Reserve Bank of India issued a circular in 2018 stopping companies from hedging their gold exposures in commodity exchanges outside the country effective July 2018. The Company had to therefore revert to hedging its gold exposure, which has also gone up significantly with the Companys gold exchange programs doing very well, in the local commodity exchanges. Given the current status of development of the market, the Company is not able to hedge gold for longer periods as required, making the process inefficient. The Company is working with authorities to remedy this situation as early as possible 6. PUBLIC DEPOSITS The Jewellery Division of the Company was successfully operating customer schemes for jewellery purchases for many years. When the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) became substantially effective from 1 st April 2014, the Company had around seven lakh subscribers TiTan Company Limi Ted46 contributing to these schemes. However, these schemes were exempt under the Companies Act, 1956 relating to acceptance of public deposits as such schemes were not covered in the definition of deposits. Under the Act and Rules made there under (Deposit Regulations) the scope of the term deposit was enlarged and therefore a view was taken that the jewellery purchase schemes offered by the Company to its customers would be treated as public deposits. Thereupon, the Company discontinued fresh enrolment of subscribers and initiated steps to close the erstwhile customer schemes, which were wound down by 31 st August 2014. Under the Deposit Regulations as amended from time to time, a company is permitted to accept deposits subject to applicable pr ovisions, to the extent of 10 of the aggregate of the paid-up share capital, securities premium account and free reserves from its Members  25 of the aggregate of the paid-up share capital, securities premium account and free reserves from the Public after prior approval by way of special resolutions passed by the Members in this regard. Requisite approval was obtained from the Members of the Company and a new customer scheme for jewellery purchase was launched in November 2014 in compliance with the Deposit Regulations. The details relating to deposits, cover ed under Chapter V of the Companies Act, 2013 are as under: (a) accepted during the year: D 2,175.37 cr ore (b) remained unpaid or unclaimed as at the end of the year: D 1,273.32 cr ore (c) whether there has been any default in r epayment of deposits or payment of interest thereon during the year and if so, number of such cases and the total amount involved- (i) at the beginning of the year: N",5000.0,806.0,3.7691493359290007,-6.414817118776437,9.0,4.0,0,3.5,3,2,yes-neutral,,"“Excellent top line growth and good working capital management helped the Company generate significantly higher levels of cash”

While the pace of economic recovery got impacted by the global geopolitical tensions and rising commodity prices, India is well placed to deal with these challenges on the back of robust macro-economic prof_ile, strong external buﬀers and healthy corporate and banking industries. India continues to remain among the fastest growing major economies in the world and I believe we are at the cusp of sustained growth and opportunity for the country. Coming to the Banks performance, we continued the execution on the Planning Cycle 5 strategy of Scale with Sustainability. We further strengthened our position across sustainability metrics, while steadily pivoting towards growth.  We persisted with our strong focus on deposit mobilisation with 15 y-o-y growth, achieved along with a reduction in cost of deposit. The cost of deposit has now come down to the lowest levels in the history of the Bank. The deposit growth was driven by granular retail deposits and CASA, which grew faster than the overall deposits.  On the loan book side, we remained watchful of the evolving operating environment. We slowed down loan disbursements during COVID-2 wave in the early part of the year and resumed loan growth cautiously once the pandemic concerns receded. Our loan growth for the year picked up by 12 y-o-y compared to 3 y-o-y for the last year.  The Bank has a unique customer franchise focused on livelihood generating loans. These are also segments of domain expertise such as vehicle f_inance, microf_inance and diamond manufacturer f_inancing. These segments continued to outperform the industry in these uncertain times as well. We also saw them participating in the economic recovery achieving one of the best quarterly disbursements in March 22.  We also progressed well on scaling up our new initiatives such as aﬄuent banking, NRI banking, tractor f_inancing, small corporates with less than 500 crores turnover, merchant acquiring, aﬀordable housing and Digital 2.0.  We continued to invest in our physical and digital distribution network. We added 250 branches during the year, increasing our branch count to 2,265 compared to 2,015 last year. We now have 5,876 distribution points (including BFIL branches  vehicle f_inance outlets) covering 1,32,000 villages across India. We also made signif_icant progress towards our Digital 2.0 journey with multiple planned launches during the year. I will cover these items in detail during the latter part of my message. Message from Managing Director  Overall, the bank continued to progress well towards its strategy of Scale with Sustainability and is now well positioned to take a leap towards sustainable growth. Sustainability is core to our business strategy. While traction on f_inancial metrics is well covered, we have also progressed ",5000.0,656.0,0.6533507786609594,26.719874364890963,0.0,1.0,1,4.0,1.0,2.0,yes-positive,,"“cusp of sustained growth and opportunity”

FY21 was an extraordinary year by any measure and it was a year of unprecedented challenges both at personal and professional levels. The year had a considerable amount of uncertainty with the virulent outbreak of COVID-19, followed by stricter lockdowns, bringing economic activities to a standstill. The Indian economy has shown great resilience towards the COVID-19 challenges and after reporting two-quarters of negative GDP , we saw a strong economic recovery in the 2nd half of FY 21. However, the economic recovery got interrupted by the 2nd wave of COVID-19. The economic impact of 2nd wave of COVID-19 has been severe but short term compared to last year. As the pandemic gets under control and the vaccination drive is lifting consumer and business conf_idence, economic recovery is expected to gain momentum as the year progresses. Measures announced by the Government of India and accommodative policies by RBI, will continue to boost the overall economic growth. We, being part of the essential services, have to balance between customer convenience and the safety of our employees. We have accorded the highest priority to continuity of the services to our customers and the safety of our employees during the pandemic. IndusInd Bank has taken several signif_icant steps in improving client experience including an All-in-One store in the IndusMobile App, Video Branch, Video KYC, Banking on WhatsApp and Alexa-based servicing, supported by Natural Language Processing. We have deployed a large scale Work From Home setup for over 15,000 staﬀ. We have also conducted a large scale vaccination drive and over 40,000 i.e 70 of the employees in the Bank and our MFI subsidiary have received a minimum of one dose of vaccine. It was my f_irst f_inancial year as the Managing Director and CEO of IndusInd Bank. We faced some internal and external challenges during the year. I can proudly say that the Bank has come out stronger from these challenges. If we look at some parameters indicating the health of the Bank, they are at their best levels in the last several years, if not in the decade. We closed the year with a capital adequacy ratio of 17.38, surplus liquidity of Rs. 40,000 crores, Credit Deposit Ratio below 85 with strong traction on retail deposits, PCR at 75 with signif_icant buﬀer provisions outside PCR, operating prof_it margin at 6 of loans  all at their best levels in the last few years. We have used this year to strengthen our balance sheet and the Bank is well positioned to participate in the growth to follow in coming years. During the f_inancial year, the Bank also adopted its f_ifth 3-year (triennial) planning cycle for the period FY 2020-23. Planning Cycle-5 (PC-5) has Scale with Sustainability as a key theme and along with growth areas, the Bank has also def_ined boundaries relating",5000.0,682.0,-4.968541363277749,11.296182804051712,67.72,1.0,1,4.0,4.0,2.0,yes,,"“The Bank has come out stronger from these challenges”

Through outcome-driven programs and initiatives, the Foundation has yielded remarkable results since its founding 10 years ago. For example, through a network of more than 187 partners, the Foundation has cumulatively invested more than  680 Crore, impacting 2.14 million lives in 21 states and three union territories. The Foundations green initiatives have helped to revitalize 52,000 acres of land, establish sustainable community governance, rejuvenate 82 water bodies, and ensure the protection and treatment of 18,000 animals across rural and urban geographies. In the process, the Foundation has forged deep-seated relationships with communities that are often excluded from the development process. Over the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the way that the Foundation and other charitable organizations operate. As the global community acted with urgency to battle the pandemic and keep people safe, the Foundation deepened its commitment to its mission of addressing socio-economic and environmental challenges through a series of sustainable programs. Some select achievements from FY21 include rural and urban programs.

real_097,HCL Technologies Limited,HCLTECH,IT Services,2020.0,Unknown,unknown,https://www.bseindia.com/bseplus/AnnualReport/532281/66229532281.pdf,,"Management Team to review our holistic remedial measures at regular intervals. HCL has had a well-defined and structured pandemic policy in place which is resilient and pragmatic and accords paramount importance to employee safety  health and client commitments. We have been actively engaged with our clients and have executed the client-specific and HCL internal operations-centric Business Continuity Plan that ensures continuity in delivering to our client and employee commitments. HCL has been constantly reviewing the situation at hand with utmost priority and fully complying with all government advisories and recommendations. Given the extended nature of this situation, we have looked at ensuring that we put medium-term sustainable measures in place to ensure continuity of all our operations and client deliverables. Our virtual governance and collaboration, both with internal and external stakeholders, allows us to execute our business with minimal interruption. Business Continuity Risk With the technology, geopolitical, societal, economic and environmental risks all coming together to create an intrinsically complex and fast-changing global risk landscape, our reputation as a leading global technology company is often measured by our resilience to threats, and how efficiently and effectively we respond to disruptive events. HCL faces business continuity risk if the organization is unable to adapt and ensure the sustainability of its continuity planning by linking it to operational resiliency across key clients, delivery locations and core enabling functions. An effective Business Continuity and Resilience program is a key risk management strategy for HCL which involves elements of preparedness, adaptiveness, recovery and restoration. HCL continually improves its Business Continuity Management (BCM) framework to ensure in the event of business disruption, we meet safety, continuity and recovery best practices for employees, assets and business services. In FY20, HCL extended the ISO 22301:2012 certification to key locations across the globe, demonstrating our focus on standardization and improvement of the resiliency posture of the company. The HCL BCM framework incorporates business continuity, disaster recovery and crisis management and is designed to adapt and respond to the rapidly changing global environment. Geopolitical Risk A substantial amount of geopolitical change is occurring in the world due to a shift in political alliances, economic interconnectedness, economic confrontations and economic imbalance of power. All of these geopolitical parameters have a direct impact on HCL business as we operate in 40 countries. Current political views create perception challenges for winning business for a foreign owned entity. Legislation which restricts the availability of work visas for skilled resources impacts our ability to deliver services which include project delays and increase cost. HCL has setup a geopolitical framework to assess geopolitical and country specific risks on a periodic basis. We have a program to continuously assess and improve our brand narrative for clients and employees worldwide. HCL has been 50 expanding its business across various countries to minimize dependence on a country for revenue growth and service delivery. HCL has also implemented the strategy of hiring local talent to avoid adverse impact on business due to various restrictions on free mobility of technical staff. Over the past few years, HCL has been leading the localization of work force through a variety of programs. HCL has invested in a flex ible work force model of onsite, onshore, near shore and offshore to address these concerns and drive the best talent to solve client business challenges. Distributed and Virtual Governance Risk Due to the work from home model, distributed and virtual governance across HCL could lead to ineffective decision making to manage an organization of this size. HCL has upscaled its business practices with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Even in normal times, HCL as a global organization operates and manages the organization remotely with leaders in various parts of the world working in a 24x7 model. There is also a healthy reliance on video conferencing and other collaboration tools so that senior management teams can connect on a regular basis. Regulatory Compliance Risk As HCL is operating in various countries and is continuously adding new industry sectors and geographies, there is an increased risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements that are relevant to its business. HCL has established a comprehensive Risk  Compliance organization that provides global analysis, assessment, policy and governance for risks related to information security, privacy, business continuity, third party engagements and operational activities. HCL has put in place a comprehensive global regulatory compliance framework to track regulatory compliances globally.

Tragically, that was not be. Nanoo, as he was known to all, suddenly passed away on 22 February 2020. For me  and for all of Bajaj Finserv  Nanoo was, and will always be, a legend. A career banker at Citibank, post-retirement Nanoo was kind enough to join as an Independent Director on the Board of your Company as of January 2008. He was much more than being just an Independent Director. Nanoo mentored me and many senior managers in Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance Ltd. (BFL), Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company (BALIC) and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company (BAGIC) on every critical aspect of business and leadership. And all done with a gentle, yet occasionally persistent, touch. It was not only that. Nanoo helped change management systems, reporting frameworks, accountabilities and quietly influenced the strategic directions of each of the companies. We have all lost a friend and a great mentor. May Nanoos soul rest in peace.Now, on to business. As you know, your Company is the holding company for the various financial services businesses under the Bajaj group. In lending, it is in the financing business through its 53 share in BFL, which is listed on The Stock Exchange, Mumbai and the National Stock Exchange. BFL has a 100 subsidiary, Bajaj Housing Finance Ltd. (BHFL), which is registered with the National Housing Bank as a housing finance company for its mortgage business. BFL also has another 100 subsidiary, Bajaj Financial Securities Ltd. (BFinSec) to address the broking business. Both your Company and BFL are included in the NSEs (National Stock Exchange) Nifty 50 index of top companies in India. The protection and savings business is done through (i) Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Ltd. (BAGIC) for general insurance including health insurance; and (ii) Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company Ltd. (BALIC) for life insurance and retirement plans. Both BAGIC and BALIC are unlisted joint ventures with Allianz SE, one of the worlds leading composite insurers. As on 31 March 2020, Bajaj Finserv held 74 of the equity capital in both BAGIC and BALIC, with the balance being held by Allianz. BFL also participates in the savings business through its fixed deposits vertical. How has each of the enterprises fared during FY2020? Chairmans Letter8 BAJAJ FINSERV LIMITEDLet me begin with BFL. Despite losing out on eight days at the end of March on account of the nation-wide COVID-19 lockdown, BFL has performed excellently. Here are some key facts: l New loans booked during FY2020 increased by 17 to 27.44 million. l Customer franchise increased by 24 to 42.60 million as of 31 March 2020. l Assets under management (AUM) grew by 27 to H 147,153 crore as of 31 March 2020. l Net interest income for FY2020 was up by 42 to H 16,913 crore. l Loan losses and provisions (expected credit loss) for FY2020 were H 3,929 crore versus H 1,501 crore in FY2019. BFL took an accelerated charge of H 392 crore for two large accounts and made a contingency provision of H 900 crore for COVID-19 . Adjusted for these one-time provisions of H 1,292 crore taken in Q4 FY2020, loan losses and provisions for FY2020 would have been H 2,637 crore. l Profit after tax (PAT) for FY2020 grew by 32 to H 5,264 crore even after absorbing the above provisions. l The capital adequacy ratio (including Tier-II capital) as of 31 March 2020 stood at 25.01. The Tier-I capital stood at 21.27. l During the year, BFL raised equity capital of approximately H 8,500 crore through the QIP route. Bajaj Housing Finance (BHFL), a 100 subsidiary of BFL, also did well in FY2020. It earned a net interest income of H 1,030 crore; profit before tax (PBT) of H 567 crore; and PAT of H 421 crore.

B. Integrated Report and Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report In keeping with the Companys valued tradition of thinking about society and not just the business, in 2016, we transitioned from compliance based reporting to governance based reporting by adopting the IR framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) (now consolidated into IFRS Foundation). Our 8th Integrated Report highlights the measures taken by the Company that contributes to long-term sustainability and value creation, while embracing different skills, continuous innovation, sustainable growth and a better quality of life. In accordance with Regulation 34(2)(f) of the SEBI Listing Regulations, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI ), in May 2021, introduced new sustainability related reporting requirements to be reported in the specific format of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR ). BRSR is a notable departure from the existing Business Responsibility Report and a significant step towards giving platform to the companies to report the initiatives taken by them in areas of Environment, Social and Governance. Further, SEBI has mandated top 1,000 listed companies, based on market capitalisation, to transition to BRSR from FY2022-23 onwards. Accordingly, we are glad to present our inaugural BRSR for FY2022-23. C. Operations and Performance 1. Tata Steel Group During the year under review, the consolidated crude steel production for Tata Steel Group ( TSG ) was 116th Year Integrated Report  Annual Accounts 2022-23228 30.65 MnT as against 31.03 MnT of FY2021-22, a marginal decline of 1. The production increased at Tata Steel Limited (Standalone) by 3, to 18.97 MnT, (FY2021-22: 18.38 MnT), Tata Steel Europe ( TSE ) produced 9.35 MnT, lower by 8 (FY2021-22: 10.11 MnT) as TSUK undertook a significant maintenance programme focused on its steelmaking assets in Port Talbot in order to improve operational stability along with weakening of market during the 2nd half of the financial year. Tata Steel Long Products (standalone) produced 0.71 MnT (FY2021-22: 0.68 MnT). Moreover, with the completion of the acquisition of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited ( NINL ) during the year, the production further increased by 0.20 MnT. Production at South-East Asia ( SEA ) was 1.43 MnT (FY2021-22: 1.86 MnT) which was lower due to disposal of Singapore operations of NatSteel Holdings Pte. Ltd. ( NSH ) during FY2021-22. The consolidated steel deliveries of TSG was at 28.79 MnT in FY2022-23 as against 29.52 MnT in FY2021-22, a marginal decrease of 2, primarily at TSE due to weakening of market and at SEA. The turnover of TSG at 2,43,353 crore was marginally lower over FY2021-22 by 606 crore. This was on account of decline in steel realisations across geographies except European operations, attributable to decrease in demand and implementation of export duty on steel in India during the year, along with lower steel deliveries by 0.73 MnT. The EBITDA of TSG for FY2022-23 at 32,698 crore was lower over FY2021-22 by 31,132 crore (49), primarily due to increase in input cost mainly in coking coal along with lower steel realisations in India. 2. India During the year under review, the crude steel production in Tata Steel Limited increased by 3 to 18.97 MnT on account of better operational performance. During the year under review, total deliveries at Tata Steel Limited (Standalone) were at 18.22 MnT (previous year: 17.62 MnT). Turnover was 1,29,007 crore (previous year: 1,29,021 crore), which was at par against the previous year mainly due to higher deliveries, offset by decline in steel prices. EBITDA was at 28,175 crore (previous year: 51,456 crore), 45 lower than that of the previous year, primarily on account of higher raw material cost, mainly coking coal. TSLP on a consolidated basis achieved crude steel production of 0.91 MnT, while deliveries stood at 0.82 MnT, both higher than previous year, due to acquisition of NINL during the year. The turnover at 8,992 crore was significantly higher on account of higher deliveries and higher prices. EBITDA was at negative 613 crore and loss after tax was at 2,304 crore. This was primarily on account of higher input cost, mainly coking coal prices along with expenditure incurred on revamping NINL which started production within 3 months of its acquisition. Increase in finance cost and depreciation and amortisation charge post NINL acquisition further impacted the profits. Total deliveries of Tata Steel from its Indian operations (including TSLP) stood at 18.87 MnT which is higher than the previous year by 3. The turnover was 1,37,030 crore, a marginal increase by 1 against previous year and EBITDA (excluding inter-company eliminations and adjustments) was 27,561 crore,",5000.0,783.0,32.74205180322073,1.6889432179652593,9.0,3.0,0,3.0,2.0,3.0,no,,"“Better operational performance,” “NINL started production within 3 months of acquisition,” “Total deliveries... higher than the previous year,” “Higher deliveries and higher prices”

The Company has an IFC framework, commensurate with the size, scale and complexity of the Companys operations. The framework has been designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to recording and providing reliable financial and operational information, complying with applicable laws, safeguarding assets from unauthorised use, executing transactions with proper authorisation and ensuring compliance with corporate policies. The controls, based on the prevailing business conditions and processes have been tested during the year and no reportable material weakness in the design or effectiveness was observed. The framework on Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting has been reviewed by the internal and external auditors. The Company uses various IT platforms to keep the IFC framework robust and our Information Management Policy governs these IT platforms. The systems, standard operating procedures and controls are implemented by the executive leadership team and are reviewed by the internal audit team whose findings and recommendations are placed before the Audit Committee. The scope and authority of the Internal Audit function is defined in the Internal Audit Charter. To maintain its objectivity and independence, the Internal Audit function reports to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Internal Audit team develops an annual audit plan based on the risk profile of the business activities. The Internal Audit plan is approved by the Audit Committee, which also reviews compliance to the plan. The Internal Audit team monitors and evaluates the efficacy and adequacy of internal control systems in the Company, its compliance with operating systems, accounting procedures and policies at all locations of the Company and its subsidiaries. Based on the report of internal audit function, process owners undertake corrective action(s) in their respective area(s) and thereby strengthen the controls. Significant audit observations and corrective action(s) thereon are presented to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee at its meetings reviews the reports submitted by the Internal Auditor. Also, the Audit Committee at frequent intervals has independent sessions with the statutory auditor and the Management to discuss the adequacy and effectiveness of internal financial controls. Risk Management Given the uncertain and volatile business environment, companies face continuous changes in technology, geo-politics, financial markets, regulations, etc. which affect the value chain. To build a sustainable business that can weather these changes, companies need to manage risk and opportunities on a pro-active basis. Keeping this in mind, the Company has adopted a robust Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process across the organisation. The objective of the ERM process is to develop a risk intelligent culture which drives informed decision making and builds resilience to adverse developments while ensuring that opportunities are exploited to create value for all stakeholders. In order to achieve this, the Company focusses on 4 broad principles viz. risk oversight, risk Infrastructure, risk process and ownership, and risk integration.  The Risk oversight function consists of the Board of Directors, Risk Management Committee (RMC) and Group Risk Review Committee (GRRC) to oversee the risk management policy, to provide guidelines for implementing the ERM framework and ERM process across the Company. The RMC also reviews the key risks that the Company faces and the progress of the mitigation plans. GRRC is a Management Committee comprising the Senior Management team as its members. The GRRC is responsible for the implementation of ERM process across the Company and providing the necessary resources, framework  structures to enable the ERM. The GRRC reviews the risks and the proposed mitigation plans and engages with risk owners regularly across the business to drive mitigation. A dedicated ERM team has been set up to deploy the ERM process across the Business Units. The ERM team is led by Group Head  Corporate Finance  Risk Management who acts as the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) of the Company.

Annual Report 2021-22 HMCL Colombia Frame assembly GLOBAL ECONOMY The world economy grew by 6.11 in FY 2021-22, posting one of the strongest post-recession recoveries in decades, as vaccination coverage gathered steam and pandemic-related restrictions eased. Private investments returned in response to a more robust demand, as governments and central banks of major economies maintained policy support. 1https:www.imf.orgenPublicationsWEOweo-database2022April 56MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RECOVERY MODERATES AS GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS, INFLATION WEIGH The world economy grew by 6.11 in FY 2021-22, posting one of the strongest post-recession recoveries in decades, as vaccination coverage gathered steam and pandemic-related restrictions eased. Private investments returned in response to a more robust demand, as governments and central banks of major economies maintained policy support. Global trade improved progressively, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. The recovery was accompanied by an increase in inflation as commodity and energy prices shot up amid global supply chain disruptions. The prices increased further in the first quarter of FY 2021-22 on account of Russia-Ukraine crisis, and the subsequent imposition of economic sanctions. In the United States, the services sector witnessed a strong rebound, though economic activity was slower in the second half of the year, due to rising inflation and supply chain issues. In western Europe, the recovery was delayed due to persisting waves of the pandemic, but as the opening became more widespread, consumer spending and demand picked up. The Eurozone grew by 5.3 in FY 2020-21, with growth forecast to moderate to 2.8 in FY 2021-22.Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) economies posted a solid recovery in FY 2020-21, growing by 6.8. Growth was driven by robust trading with partners, higher commodity prices and favourable external financing conditions. On the domestic front, progress on vaccinations, continued fiscal support in some countries and accumulated savings from FY 2019-20 also supported growth. Middle East and North Africa (MENA) rebounded with a growth of 5.8 in FY 2020-21. Demand increased in the region amid stronger investment growth and robust private spending. Growth in the region was also driven by higher oil production, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) tapered output cuts, and a high price environment. The Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) grew by 4.5 in FY 2020-21. Recovery and vaccination remained varied in the region, depending on country-specific factors. The overall rebound was fuelled by elevated commodity prices, a relaxation of stringent pandemic measures and a recovery in global trade. OUTLOOK The IMF projects the world economy to grow by 3.6 in FY 2021-22, supported by healthy demand, improving supply chain, softening of commodity prices and the kickstart of a strong capex cycle. Most major economies appear to have crossed their pre-pandemic output levels, but potential headwinds pose downside risks to growth forecasts.WORLD GDP GROWTH Region GDP Growth Rate 2020 2021 (F) 2022 (F) World Output -3.1 6.1 3.6 Advanced Economies -4.5 5.2 3.3 United States -3.4 5.7 3.7 Euro Area -6.4 5.3 2.8 Japan -4.5 1.6 2.4 United Kingdom -9.3 7.4 3.7 Emerging Market and De",5000.0,767.0,6.612287126125567,26.6325031186174,0.0,5.0,2,4.0,4.0,2.0,yes,,"“World’s largest motorcycle logo… recognised by the Guinness World Records”

Currently , one dual objective well LKEAA in KG Basin is under drilling. Efforts are on to establish the shale gasoil potential in the identified blocks. Indications of presence of shale oil have been recorded in wells like - JMSGA, NSGB and NJSGA in Cambay Basin and WGSGA in KG Basin during activation after hydro-fracturing. One zone within Nawagam Middle Pay (Tight Reservoir) of shale well NGSGA of Cambay Basin was hydro-fractured and on activation produced oil. The shale well WGSGA in KG Basin, requires further activation whereas in another well GNSGC in Cambay Basin hydro-fracturing job is to be carried out. c. Underground Coal Gasification: Y our Company had taken an initiative to test the Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) technology in India for which all the ground work has been completed with obligatory inputs for construction and implementation of UCG RD Pilot Project at Vastan Mine block site belonging to GIPCL in Naninaroli, Surat district, Gujarat to establish UCG technology. However, there is not much progress as all state PSUs of Gujarat, including MOU partner, Gujarat Industries Power Company Limited, backed out of the UCG project due to the low calorific value of the Syngas. Additionally , processing of gas at surface shall be a challenge as Syngas has many impurities and contamination, and also non-availability of business partners from Coal Chemical Power sectors for business ease during pilot commercialization. Considering all the factors and current gas price scenario, your Company might not commit further in this line of business. d. Gas Hydrat e Exploration Program Y our Company has been an active contributor to gas hydrates exploratory research under National Gas Hydrate Program (NGHP) of GoI since its inception in the year 1997. So far, your Company has played a significant role in successful execution of NGHP-01 and NGHP RD Expedition-02. With the focus on the pilot production testing, the gas hydrate reservoirs discovered during NGHP-02 (Block KG-DWN-985) have been delineated and Geo-cellular modelling for the gas hydrate rich reservoir has been completed to 56get detailed cell-wise geophysicalreservoir parameters around the proposed site for pilot production test during next NGHP-03 expedition. P otential exploitation methodologies like sand control measures, well design, well bore completions and depressurization techniques, various production simulation modelling and other studies have been carried out in collaboration with USA. Gas Hydrate Research  T echnology Centre (GHRTC) of your Company is involved in RD activities in exploration for gas hydrate prospects in Indian deep waters and potential exploitation methodologies for gas hydrates through in-house efforts and PAN-IIT collaborations. This institute will also contribute to GoIs plan to commercialize Gas Hydrates as energy resource, at the earliest. Presently , your Company has been working on identification of gas hydrate prospective areas in part of CY -DWN-20041 and MNDWN-20021 blocks in Cauvery and Mahanadi Basin respectively for future field expeditions. Besides, your Company has also been working on pre-stack seismic data analysis for Gas hydrates characterizationdelineation in part of KGDWN 982 Block in KG offshore. 13.

Yet in the current year, India has also faced the challenge of reining in inflation that the European strife accentuated. Measures taken by the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), along with the easing of global commodity prices, finally managed to bring retail inflation below the RBI upper tolerance target in March 2023. In the process of arresting rising inflation, during FY23, the RBI hiked interest rates by 2.5 in six tranches. Indias economic growth is expected to be brisk in FY24, as a vigorous credit disbursal and capital investment cycle is expected to unfold in India with the strengthening of balance sheets in the corporate and banking sectors. Direct tax revenue collections have been highly buoyant and so have GST collections, which should ensure the full expending of the Capex budget within the budgeted fiscal deficit. Further, support to economic growth will come from the expansion of public digital platforms and path-breaking measures such as PM GatiShakti, the National Logistics Policy, and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes to boost manufacturing output. The capital expenditure initiatives of the central government are another growth driver of the Indian economy. A sustained increase in private Capex is imminent with the strengthening of the balance sheets of corporates and the consequent increase in credit financing it has been able to generate. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has been directly providing jobs in UltraTech Cement Limited 118 Integrated and Sustainability Report 2022-23 rural areas and indirectly creating opportunities for rural households to diversify their sources of income generation. Schemes like PM-Kisan and PM Garib Kalyan Yojana have helped in ensuring food security in the country. Despite strong global headwinds and tighter domestic monetary policy, the IMF expects India to grow around 5.9 in 2023. This growth, without the advantage of a base effect, reflects Indias underlying economic resilience  its ability to recoup, renew, and re-energise the growth drivers of the economy. Indias economic resilience can be seen in the domestic stimulus to growth seamlessly replacing the external stimuli. Structural reforms implemented by the government have resulted in ease of doing business. The release of Urban Real Estate demand was reflected in the housing market too as demand for housing loans picked up. At  19,36,428 crores at the end of March 2023, outstanding housing loans have grown by an absolute 14.9 and 42.2 compared to a respective  16,84,424 crores a year ago and  13,61,880 crores at the end of March 2020. Consequently, housing inventories have declined, prices are firming up, and construction of new dwellings is picking up pace, and this has stimulated innumerable backward and forward linkages that the construction sector is known to carry. The universalisation of COVID-19 vaccination coverage also has a significant role in lifting the housing market as, in its absence, the migrant workforce could not have returned to construct new dwellings. Apart from housing, construction activity, in general, has significantly risen in FY23 as the much-enlarged capital budget of the central government and its public sector enterprises is rapidly being deployed.Cement Industry during FY23 The countrys cement demand is expected to climb by around 10 over fiscal year 2023, as reported by a leading ratings agency. The growing housing sector, which typically accounts for 60 to 65 of Indias cement consumption, will remain a key demand driver. Also, continued large investments in roads and infrastructure projects will fuel cement demand. In the Union Budget 202324, the government has allocated US 1.8 billion for the creation of safe housing, clean drinking water, and sanitation, and increasing road and telecom connectivity, among other initiatives. The government has also allocated US 9.6 billion to address housing shortages. As per a post-budget report by a research affiliate of a credit rating agency, cement demand is expected to witness third straight year of growth with a 7 to 9 jump to 425 million tonnes in FY24. In FY24, infrastructure and affordable rural housing segments are expected to propel growth, where the highest traction is expected from roads, where the total annual outlay for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has seen an increase of 25 and 14, respectively. The government has also increased budget outlay for affordable rural housing under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana  Gramin (PMAY-G) by 12.5 for FY24.

Other Income Other income is marginally lower mainly on account of lower government grants compared to the previous year. Operating Profit (PBIDT) and Margin PBIDT for the year at  11,754 crores is 25 higher than the previous year. Operating margin improved on account of volume growth and better sales realisation. Cost Highlights (i) Energy Cost Overall energy cost declined 3.5 from  985t in the previous year to  950t, mainly on account of saving in power consumption and increase in green power mix. Furthermore, your Company continuously works towards efficiency improvement. Key initiatives in this regard are:  Commissioning of 7 MW Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS) capacity. Your Company will commission another 72 MW of WHRS capacity during FY22, taking the total WHRS capacity to 197 MW. There is plan to further increase this to 302 MW by FY24, which will cater to 26 of the total power requirement.  Increase solar and wind power capacity from 125 MW to 350 MW by the end of FY22 and cater to 7 of the total power requirement. Use low-cost fuel viz. industrial waste. Continuous improvement in thermal power plant efficiency by reducing auxiliary consumption power. (ii) Input Material Cost Raw material cost rose marginally from  493t to  504t due to an increase in additive and fly ash prices. Increase in diesel prices impacted inbound transportation, resulting in higher raw material cost. Your Company is continuously working on improving share of blended and premium products in its product mix, leading to an improvement in overall profitability. (iii) Freight and Forwarding Expenses Logistics cost saw marginal increase from  1,144t to  1,158t, due to increase in diesel cost and lead distance on account of change in market mix. Synergies arising out of the integration of acquired assets aided in lowering the impact. Employee Costs Employee cost stood at  2,182 crores as compared to  2,336 crores in the previous year. This is a one-time gain on account of lower expenses towards retirement benefits and staff welfare expenses, during the year. Depreciation At  2,434 crores, depreciation for the year is lower by  21 crores over the previous year, mainly on account of few assets being fully depreciated. Finance Cost Reduction in finance cost from  1,704 crores to  1,259 crores was mainly on account of lower borrowings and interest rates during the financial year.Directors Report and Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.) Your Company undertook various initiatives during the year to support the country in its fight against the pandemic. Your Company has the unique advantage of being able to cater to demand in different parts of the country and its focus on conserving cash continues unabated. All this has resulted in your Company emerging stronger and well prepared in the wake of the ongoing pandemic. Your Company is closely monitoring the impact of the second wave of the pandemic on its operations while giving primacy to the safety and well-being of its employees and business partners.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW IT Services Global economic activity experienced a sharper-than- expected slowdown in the fiscal year 2023. With central banks raising interest rates and food and energy prices coming down, global inflation is gradually subsiding. This has resulted in marginal improvement in business and household buying power. The near-term outlook remains highly uncertain with downside risks from the unpredictable course of the geopolitical conflict in Europe, continued impact from tighter monetary policy, inflation and recession fears, pressures in global energy markets reappearing, and financial market volatility. Rapid tightening of fiscal policies has exposed vulnerabilities both among banks and non-bank financial institutions, with fluctuations in financial conditions due to shifts in market sentiment. This may result in slowdown in demand in certain markets and lead to delayed decision making. Technology spending is forecasted to increase with enterprises investing in value-driven transformation focused on areas like cloud transformation, automation, integration of AI, data analytics and cyber security as their top priorities. The demand for digital transformation and infrastructure modernization will continue to drive growth for the industry with accelerated adoption of digital and emerging technologies, such as next generation AI, augmented reality ( AR ), virtual reality (VR ), extended reality, web3 and metaverse, 5G and edge, cyber and bio convergence. While emerging technologies will disrupt industries, they will also pose new risks in the areas of data privacy, surveillance and ownership. Global IT service providers are equipped to support enterprises across various industries to overcome the current challenges, with a wide range of offerings in software development, digital transformation, IT business solutions and consulting, research and development, technology infrastructure and business process services. The IT services industry is expected to accelerate and drive decisions in fiscal year 2024 based on investments made by clients in cost optimization, operational excellence, digital transformation, vendor consolidation, productivity improvement, customer experience programs, innovation in products and services, talent management, future of workplace and workforce, and environmental, social, and governance initiatives. According to the Strategic Review 2023 published by NASSCOM ( NASSCOM Report ), revenue for the Indian IT services sector is expected to witness growth of 8.3 year-on-year in fiscal year 2023, led by IT modernization including application modernization, cloud migration and platformization. Digital revenues are estimated to account for 32-34 of total industry revenue, growing at 16 annually in fiscal year 2023. IT services contracts will include a significant digital component, led by digital transformation, cloudification, platform engineering, AI, building software-as-a-service ( SaaS ) enabled products and associated consulting services. According to the NASSCOM Report, next-generation technologies, such as sensor technology, smart robots, autonomous driving, computer vision, deep learning, autonomous analytics, ARVR, sustainability technology, edge computing, distributed ledger, spacetech and 5G6G are expected to witness twice the average growth in fiscal year 2023. The NASSCOM Report estimates that revenue for the engineering services sector will grow 11 year-on-year, Ambitions Realized . 28 Reporting Context Our Capabilities Governance and Leadership Performance Overview reaching 41 billion in fiscal year 2023, led by increasing softwarization of equipment and devices, ad cloudification, next-generation connectivity solutions (e.g. Industrial IoT), autonomous tech, 5G, cloud engineering, EV technology (e.g. electric batteries) and digital engineering (e.g. platform engineering and device-as-a-service). Enterprises are prioritizing cost takeout and operational excellence initiatives and are bearish on discretionary spends. Significant opportunities exist as clients realign vendor portfolios. Industry verticals such as Banking  Financial services, Hi-tech, and Retail  Consumer are showing signs of caution in their technology spending in response to financial market instabilities, cost pressures, lingering inflation, and weak consumer spending. Telecom clients are expected to prioritize monetizing their 5G investments while verticals such as Healthcare, Utilities, Automotive are expected to be the bright spots and stay resilient. Focus on ESG parameters will continue to be a driver for differentiation. Clients expect providers to not only meet the global standards on ESG, but also help the client make progress on their ESG goals across key focuses such as climate change, diversity and inclusion, corporate governance and cybersecurity.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS Business Environment in the international markets remained unfavourable in Q4 and declining trends were witnessed in the category across countries. For Titan, high-contributing Middle East markets continued to decline while younger markets like the Philippines, Thailand and the US stayed on the plan to deliver impressive retail growths on the back of several sales  marketing initiatives. The business delivered the budgeted bottom-line for FY18-19, but steep declines in Middle East markets left the overall business with a 10 decline for the year. FY19-20 plans will continue the journey of reducing dependence on Middle East markets and continue with investments in newer consumer bases (locals, across Middle East), markets (US, EU) and channels (e-commerce).3. DIvIDEND The Directors are pleased to recommend the payment of dividend on equity shares at the rate of 500 (i.e. D 5 per equity share of D 1 each), subject to approval by the shareholders at the ensuing Annual General Meeting (AGM). 4. TRANSFER TO GENERAL RESER vE The Board of Directors has decided to retain the entire amount of profits for FY 2018-19 in the Retained Earnings. 5. FINANCE Excellent top line growth and good working capital management helped the Company generate significantly higher levels of cash in the financial year. This resulted in substantially higher interest and other income from the surplus cash generated. However, as part of the treasury operations which were in line with the Investment Policy approved by the Board, the Company during the year had also invested D 145 crore in the 6 month inter corporate deposits with the ILFS Group based on the high credit ratings assigned to them and assessment of risk profile at the time of investing. Unfortunately, the financial distress of the ILFS Group was made evident after credit rating agencies downgraded the ratings to default status from the AAA they had assigned earlier when the Company had invested. The Company has therefore, as a measure of prudence, fully provided for this investment. The Company has also revisited its Investment Policy and created an Investment Committee of the Board to monitor investments going forward. The Reserve Bank of India issued a circular in 2018 stopping companies from hedging their gold exposures in commodity exchanges outside the country effective July 2018. The Company had to therefore revert to hedging its gold exposure, which has also gone up significantly with the Companys gold exchange programs doing very well, in the local commodity exchanges. Given the current status of development of the market, the Company is not able to hedge gold for longer periods as required, making the process inefficient. The Company is working with authorities to remedy this situation as early as possible 6. PUBLIC DEPOSITS The Jewellery Division of the Company was successfully operating customer schemes for jewellery purchases for many years. When the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) became substantially effective from 1 st April 2014, the Company had around seven lakh subscribers TiTan Company Limi Ted46 contributing to these schemes. However, these schemes were exempt under the Companies Act, 1956 relating to acceptance of public deposits as such schemes were not covered in the definition of deposits. Under the Act and Rules made there under (Deposit Regulations) the scope of the term deposit was enlarged and therefore a view was taken that the jewellery purchase schemes offered by the Company to its customers would be treated as public deposits. Thereupon, the Company discontinued fresh enrolment of subscribers and initiated steps to close the erstwhile customer schemes, which were wound down by 31 st August 2014. Under the Deposit Regulations as amended from time to time, a company is permitted to accept deposits subject to applicable pr ovisions, to the extent of 10 of the aggregate of the paid-up share capital, securities premium account and free reserves from its Members  25 of the aggregate of the paid-up share capital, securities premium account and free reserves from the Public after prior approval by way of special resolutions passed by the Members in this regard.

The last year was extraordinarily challenging for everyone, including our consumers, our people, our business associates and the community at large. However, it was the resilience and positive spirit of all stakeholders that led your Companys performance to belie, to a large extent, the difficult circumstances during the year, which were brought about by emerging variants of the COVID-19, geo -political tensions and their accompanying effects on the macro-economic environment. In the VUCA world, we remained committed to our purpose of creating shared value for all. Your Company will remain focused on fortifying its three core assets, namely brand, people and culture, which will ensure that it continues to withstand the seemingly constant forces of unpredictability and disruption.

The internal audit programme is reviewed by the Audit Committee at the beginning of the year to ensure that the coverage of the areas is adequate. Reports of the internal auditors are regularly reviewed by the management and corrective action is initiated to strengthen the controls and enhance the effectiveness of the existing systems. Summaries of the reports and actions taken on audit findings are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board. We have also deployed audit analytics in the domains of sales, procurement, manufacturing, supply chain and employee spends. It helps in continuous control monitoring of control effectiveness and areas where actions are required. The Internal Controls team reviews output of this tool and derives corrective action on timely basis. In order to strengthen control environment, audit analytics will be deployed in other functions of Maricos India operations as well as key international geographies.Deloitte T ouche T ohmatsu India, LLP has carried out our internal audit in the year under review. The work of internal auditors is coordinated by an internal team at our end. This combination of our internal team and expertise of a professional firm ensure independence as well as effective value addition and protection. Internal Financial Controls (IFC) As per section 134 (5) (e) of Companies Act 2013, IFC means the policies and procedures adopted by company for ensuring:  Accuracy and completeness of accounting records  Orderly and efficient conduct of business, including adherence to policies  Safeguarding of its assets  Prevention and detection of fraudsWe have implemented a robust internal financial controls framework within the Company. The Internal Financial Controls have been documented and embedded in the business processes. Design and operating effectiveness of controls are tested by the management annually and later audited by statutory auditors. Statutory auditors have issued an unqualified report after checking the effectiveness of these controls. The management believes that strengthening IFC is a continuous process and therefore it will continue its efforts to make the controls smarter with focus on preventive and automated controls as opposed to mitigating manual controls. The Company has robust ERP and other supplementary IT systems which are integral part of internal control framework. The Company continues to constantly leverage technology in enhancing the internal controls. On a voluntary basis, our material subsidiary, Marico Bangladesh Limited (MBL ) has also adopted this framework. Over time, we will extend this framework to our other overseas subsidiaries.

As the war draws on and sanctions and retaliatory actions intensify, shortages, volatility in commodity and financial markets, supply dislocations and most alarmingly, persistent and rapidly spreading inflationary pressures are becoming more acute day by day. Over the first half of 2021, an uneven and divergent global recovery began to take shape with the ebbing of the Delta variant driven COVID 19 infections and the gathering pace and scale of vaccination. In the second half of 2021, the global recovery became hostage to the Omicron variant though the wave turned out to be short lived and global trade recovered amidst supply and logistics bottlenecks. The International Monetary Funds April, 2022 World Economic Outlook placed global GDP growth for the year at 6.1. The Indian Economy has shown resilience, drawing upon the innate strength of its underlying fundamentals and supported by a prudent and favourable policy mix. The rebound in domestic economic activity that took hold with the waning of the Omicron wave is turning out to be increasingly broad based. Private consumption is regaining traction on the back of recuperating contact-intensive services and rising of discretionary spending. Government consumption has crossed pre-pandemic levels and overall the Indian economy consolidated its recovery with most constituents surpassing pre-pandemic levels of activity. INDIAN PAINT INDUSTRY The Indian Paint Industry is today worth over INR 62000 crore (USD 8 billion), and is the fastest growing major paint economy the world over, with a consistent double digit growth over the last two decades except 2020 and 2021. The last two years have not been the best of times for the Indian paints and coatings industry due to multiple waves of COVID 19 pandemic though it did not retard the pace of new investments and capacity expansions in the Indian paint and coatings industry.

Since then, lives have been lost, surviving life has been disrupted and lifestyles have been fundamentally altered. While the pandemic was sudden and devastatingly swift, the policy response was unprecedented and expansive in its reach. Governments and Central Banks across the globe fashioned measures in the form of additional public expenditure, foregone revenues, capital injections and facilitating additional avenues of lending adding upto US16 trillion or 15.3 of world GDP. Economies across the world fell off a virtual cliff in the second quarter of 2020, plunging to depths of contraction not fathomed before, but in the second half of the year a robust recovery materialised, relatively faster than anticipated. In India, a calibrated policy stimulus began with direct assistance in cash and kind to the economically distressed and progressively broadened into a comprehensive package to provide support to the various sectors of the economy in 2021. It cumulated to 15.7 of GDP including liquidity and other measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India. In the first wave, the pandemic fury was at its height in Quarter 1 (2020-21). The Indian economy contracted 24.4 year on year, the deepest downturn amongst the G20 countries. In Quarter 2, however, the contraction started to ease reflecting vigorous efforts to revive the economy with gradual relaxation of mobility restrictions, monetary and liquidity easing and fiscal support. By Quarter 3 (Financial Year 2020-21) India had pulled out from a technical recession. The cumulative effect of supply disruptions, the health crisis, an unparalleled interstate movement of migrant labour and a hostile global environment took a heavy toll on the Indian economy but could not suppress the indomitable spirit of entrepreneurship of Indians. A cyclical slowdown had preceded the pandemic, causing a sequential deceleration in the real GDP growth rates since 2017-18, which subsequently slumped into contraction under the onslaught of corona virus.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAINT INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENTThe Indian paint industry can be broadly divided into two segments  decorative and industrial. Decorative paints include higher end acrylic exterior and interior emulsions, medium range exterior and interior paints, low end distempers, wall putty, wood coatings, cement paints, primers and thinners. These account for almost 70 of the paint market in India. Decorative paints can be either water based or solvent based, the latter being commonly known as enamels. The category share of water based paints (or emulsions) is on the rise in India owing to superior aesthetics, durability, washability and environmental reasons. Solvent based paints or enamels continue to attract attention in certain traditional market segments though the percentage share of overall paint consumption in both volume and value terms seem to be on the decline. Industrial paints essentially comprise general industrial, automotive, protective, powder, glass, can and pipe coatings. The Company is present in all these areas. In addition, there are niche segments such as coil coatings, automotive refinish coatings and marine coatings and the Company deals with many of these through its subsidiaries, joint ventures and strategic alliances. During the year, Indias economic growth slowed down somewhat to about 4.2. In the final quarter, the growth rate of domestic product fell to 3.1, reflecting an impact of the first week of COVID 19 lockdown which began on 25th March, 2020. The markets were already affected before the lockdown due to the doubts surrounding the situation. In spite of a lower overall growth and sharp lockdown related decline at the end of the year, the Company and the paint industry performed reasonably well.

The primary aim was to develop a strategic plan and roadmap for dengue control in India, with inputs from endemic states. The plan has been formulated and finalized. It is being implemented by the states and serves as a foundational framework for GoI and endemic states in managing and controlling dengue, chikungunya, and Zika-related diseases.  By the fiscal year 2025-26, our objective is to safeguard 30 million people against vector-borne diseases. A total of 3,452 Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers received training in vector-borne disease prevention and control methods.  A Collaboration with the National Centre for Vector-Borne Diseases Control (NCVBDC) and GoUP , we conducted 20 outbreak surveillance visits to manage dengue and Zika outbreaks. 137 participants underwent training on entomological surveillance, clinical management of malaria, and outbreak investigation across 29 States and and Union Territories. 227 Transforming solid waste and plastic management As a global FMCG player and responsible corporate, we commit to reducing waste across all our plants, processes, products, and supply chain. For the past five financial years, we have achieved zero waste to landfills from our manufacturing units. Beyond managing our manufacturing waste, we recognize our responsibility to work with communities to manage waste. We collect 100 of the plastic waste we generate each year, as per Indian EPR laws, and collaborate with civic agencies, social enterprises, and citizens groups to promote material reuse and recycling. We invest in helping communities around our offices and plant locations to identify and address their waste-related issues using circular economy principles. Since FY 2020-21, we have partnered with the Puducherry Municipal Corporation on a community waste management project, reaching over 200,000 people. We digitally track waste management processes, raise awareness on door-to-door collection and source segregation, and have diverted over 1500 MT of waste from landfills through clean-up drives and door to door collection. We established a sanitation park processing 4 TPD of waste and provided medical camps for 1,104 waste workers. Our detailed project plan for sustainable waste management has influenced new tenders from the Government of Puducherry. Our three-year project with Malanpur Nagar Parishad covers all 15 wards, aiming for zero waste to landfill and breaking even on operational costs by the third year. As of FY 2023-24, we diverted 1,329MT of waste from landfills. Our integrated decentralized solid waste management system in the Palashbari Municipal Board, Kamrup district, Assam, covers all 10 municipal wards and surrounding commercial zones. The project aims to break even on operational costs. Till FY 2023-24, it diverted 2,214MT of waste from landfills.In Kasauli, Solan district, Himachal Pradesh, we launched a municipal waste management project to tackle the increasing garbage issues impacting the areas natural beauty. In FY 2022-23, we conducted a baseline assessment in the Kasauli cantonment area and five surrounding Panchayats. In FY23-24 we organized cleaning drives, established waste-themed art installations, and engaged school children to raise awareness, diverting 652 kgs of waste. In Goa, we partnered with the Goa State Pollution Control Board and Goa Waste Management Corporation on a three-year waste management project with Bicholim and Sattari Municipal Councils. Implemented by the Mineral Foundation of Goa and Sampurn(E)arth, this project serves approximately 2.9 lakh people. In FY 2023-24, we diverted 1,449 MT of waste from landfills. Overall, we diverted 7,278 MT of waste from landfills since 2019 and our goal is to transform waste management systems in five municipalities and divert over 8,000 MT of waste from landfills by FY2025-26 through collaborative partnership. 228 Investing in watershed management to help restore ecological balance Our integrated watershed development project is dedicated to restoring the ecological balance in the drought-prone district of Siddipet in Telangana. To address the water scarcity issue, weve joined forces with NABARD and a local NGO to rejuvenate the land, replenish groundwater levels, facilitate essential irrigation, prolong cropping cycles, enhance both the quality and quantity of produce, improve livelihoods, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.Integrated watershed management We have successfully treated 2,950 hectares of land, covering the total project area. To date, weve distributed over 8.5 lakh saplings for direct planting and seed dibbling.

The following year, to present our shareholders with a more holistic view of how we create and sustain long-term value, we included key elements of the Integrated Report (IR) along with the Annual Report. While staying true to the principles of the International Integrated ANNOUNCEMENT Reporting Councils framework that was incorporated in the past, this year our Integrated Report structure has evolved to create a m ore reader-friendly experience. This IR is in consonance with SEBIs circular dated 6th February 2017. An Integrated Report takes corporate reporting beyond just discussing the ï¬nancial resources, as any value creation activity requires other resources like people, natural resources and business relationships. This report will discuss how Mahindra  M ahindra Ltd. creates value by leveraging the interlinkages between these interdependent resources. Where necessary, we have explained the concept using charts and infographics. Some IR related data might be management estimates and could be updated in subsequent publications, like the Mahindra Sustainability Report.03 31 46 47 20506 20 27 03MAHINDRA  MAHINDRA LTD. INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2018-19 Businesses exist to create value for their diverse stakeholders. Today, businesses depend on more than just ï¬nancial capital or plant and machinery to create this value. Employees and the environment are signiï¬cant factors, as are governance and the relationship with vendors, suppliers, the community in which businesses operate, and the society at large. A b usinesss ability to sustain value over the long-term depends on how it manages, utilises and integrates all these tangible and intangible resources. This Integrated Report begins with an overview of the business and its ethos, and then elaborates on how the business sustains value using a robust governance framework. It also explains in detail how the pursuit of excellence fuels strategy, mitigates risks, and ampliï¬es opportunities for the business. HOW TO READ THIS REPORT We also use an easy-to-understand diagram to depict inputs, outputs and outcomes, that is measured by KPIs. The report structure this year remains true to the principles of integrated reporting and seeks to create a m ore lucid ï¬‚ow of information for a crisp and coherent disclosure. The detailed Statutory Statements and Financial Reports are also part of this document and are in line with the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013 (including the rules made thereunder), Indian Accounting Standards, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and the applicable Secretarial Standards. The reporting period of Mahindra  Mahindra Ltd. for this Integrated Report is 1st April, 2018 to 31st March, 2019. It provides an overview of the operations and business development activities of the Company. This Integrated Report is also aligned to the nine principles of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs National Voluntary Guidelines (NVG) on the social, environmental and economic responsibilities of a b usiness.Scope of the Report The scope of this Integrated Report is restricted to the domestic business of Mahindra  M ahindra Limited and Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Limited, consisting of the Automotive Sector, Farm Equipment Sector, Spares Business Unit, Mahindra Research Valley, Two-Wheeler Division, Construction Equipment Division and Powertrain Business Division.

We have also shown the data related to other group businesses and companies, wherever required, to provide a h olistic view of the companys performance and presence.Taking a broader view, Integrated Reporting covers not only the nancial health of an organisation, but also considers factors such as innovation that enhances our way of life, environment that impacts our planet, and society that determines our license to operate.Integrated Report IR 04 COMP ANY OVERVIEW DRIVEN BY EXCELLE NCE BUILD ING FOR THE FUTU RE FOCU SSED ON SUSTAINAB ILITY CORPORA TE INFORMA TION STATUTO RY REPORTS FINANC IAL STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS FINANCIAL (MM  MVML) Net Sales  Operating Income Grew by 11.1 to 52,848 crore in F19 compared to L 47,577 crore in F18  Top-line crossed 50,000 crore mark for the rst time EBITDA Grew by 6.9 ",5000.0,749.0,10.3977175010164,1.91608553578063,9.0,9.0,1,4,4,5,yes-positive,,"“Commitment towards transparency and the highest standards of corporate governance”

Note: Patient names have been withheld from all case studies and patient testimonials in this report in order to protect patient privacy. Message FR oM the Chai RMan Dear Members, The second decade of the twenty-first century will be the decade of Non- Communicable diseases (NCDs). The World Economic Forum and the United Nations have both warned that the world will face a huge NCD crisis in the next ten years in the form of diabetes, heart disease, strokes, cancer, respiratory disorders, infectious diseases and obesity. It is estimated that by the end of this decade, 80 of deaths worldwide will be from NCDs, which will amount to a staggering global cost of USD 30 Trillion, with Indias share of that cost being USD 4.8 Trillion. It is a huge threat that no family, corporate or nation can sustain. It has been always our endeavour to work with Governments, corporates and communities in general, to reduce this burden, especially for younger people in the age group of 30-60, who are precious to their employers, their families, and above all to the nation. In pursuit of the well-being of people at large, we have devised specific programs for diabetes management, detection of risk factors and corrective treatment for heart disease, strokes and cancer. It is important to remember that cancer, if detected early, can be easily controlled through surgery, including robotic surgery. For more advanced cases, we also have state-of-the-art Photon therapy, through Novalis, Tomo and Halcyon machines, and Proton therapy. Our Proton Centre in Chennai, is the first-of-its kind in South East Asia and people from all over the world come here for treatment. Today, we are not only the No. 1 provider of cardiac services, we are marching towards making India the best cancer care center in the world. As a definitive step towards combating NCDs, and to encourage early-detection and prevention, we have completed over 22 million Preventive Health Checks so far. We have now created a new program Apollo ProHealth, powered by Artificial Intelligence, which will help Predict, Prevent and Overcome NCDs. The program includes personalised healthcare under the supervision of health mentors. The second decade of the twenty-first century will also see the advent of Artificial Intelligence, Automation, Robotics and 3-D printing in Healthcare. We have already adopted all of these to make a significant impact in the way we manage our patients and their medical conditions, with precision. I am happy to share that the Apollo Hospitals network is performing the highest number of robot-assisted surgeries in the country; we have also started using robots for cardiac procedures now. Suddenly and unexpectedly, in the month of March 2020, another major health crisis erupted for the world with the COVID-19 pandemic. We launched Project Kavach, an integrated and holistic plan for the fight against COVID-19. Kavach includes modalities for screening, testing, assessment, isolation, treatment, monitoring and follow-up. We have designated close to 2,000 beds across our hospitals for COVID-19. We have been working with the Governments of 16 states where our hospitals are located. We have set up fever clinics in 30 locations. So far, we have made a positive difference to the lives of over 30,000 patients and we will continue to extend care. During this time, we also launched our digital healthcare app Apollo 247 - agile and digitally connected to the consumer, and we have been humbled by the response - 3.7 million registered users, 3,200 doctors live on the platform, over 125,000 digital consults till date and over 12.7 million COVID-19 risk scans completed. While managing COVID-19 as well as other ailments, we have created an iron curtain, in all our hospitals, between COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients so that the safety of the hospitals for the non-COVID-19 patients is not compromised. We have also fully separated the staff - doctors, nurses, housekeeping staff and others - and are housing them separately. This has helped us to make our facilities completely safe for the treatment of normal medical and surgical procedures as they arise. Against the backdrop of COVID-19, it has now become abundantly clear that controlling NCDs, especially conditions like hypertension and diabetes is critical for building immunity to protect oneself from infections that can become life threatening. The prevailing social stigma around COVID-19, coupled with the fear of contracting infections may have made patients rather lax about their health, lifestyle, regular medications and follow-up for their ailments. There is an urgent need to bring in a behavioural shift and ensure that people do not ignore conditions and illnesses, which may become life-threatening if left unattended.

Risk factors such as a persons background; lifestyle and environment are known to increase the likelihood of certain non-communicable diseases. These include age, gender, genetics, exposure to air pollution, and behaviors such as smoking, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity which can lead to hypertension and obesity.

Among these topics, 6 were relevant in the last financial year as well. Compliance has not been identified as a critical topic in FY20 as APSEZ has strong systems in place to maintain compliance with both national and international laws and regulations as a result of which, there was no case of non-compliance during the reporting period. In FY19, APSEZ implemented a comprehensive stakeholder engagement process to identify material issues, However, during the current financial year, we have redefined the way we identify those topics that impact our ability to create value for our stakeholder Thus a laundry list of 74 topics was identified through stakeholder consultations, external research and assessments. APSEZ has established an enterprise risk management framework in identifying various business risks. These risks also include non-financial risks such as Environment, Social and Governance risks. The ESG risks occupy an important place in our assessment process as they can have a significant impact (positive and negative)  on the Companys business model and value drivers such as revenue growth, margins and required capital. Global megatrends have the potential to impact our business in the long-term. Hence, it is important for us to be cognisant of global megatrends as they will enable APSEZ to drive growth and innovation in a dynamic business environment. We collected stakeholder feedback during the year through online surveys, ESG assessments as well as reviews of existing documentation; feedback from ESG evaluators and social and traditional media content was also garnered. Our key stakeholder groups include, but are not limited to: employees, customers, suppliers, investors, government, local communities, NGOs and media. Apart from the existing mechanisms of engagement, we conduct an exclusive exercise to engage with our key stakeholders biennially. Feedback received is documented and analysed by our internal team identifying opportunities for improvement. The objective was to identify those non-financial aspects, which directly or indirectly impact our ability to create value for our shareholders in the short-medium-and long term.

Their key research focus will be immunology, oncology, biologics and cell and gene therapies.  Global RD spend is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 3 by 2024, lower than that of 4.2 between 2010 and 2018, partially driven by companies focus on smaller indications, with lower clinical development costs.  Digital technologies will be the most transformative force for healthcare. The ongoing uptake for artificial intelligence and machine learning will carry important implications within data science for optimisation of decision-making, ethical handling of patient privacy, and proper use and management of extensive and complex data sets.  Digital technologies are being leveraged significantly for patient-to-doctor connect currently since a face-to-face consultation may not be possible due to COVID-19. It remains to be seen if this trend will continue in the post COVID-19 period also. One of the most dependable sources to generate key patient insights will be genomic data, as it facilitates an understanding of the genetic basis of diseases and treating genetically driven diseases with targeted gene -based therapies.  Payors (reimbursement companies) are likely to keep working towards reducing costs. While initiatives to improve access to high-priced innovative products are being implemented, cost containment remains high on payors agendas in the developed markets. This will contribute to a gradual moderation in the overall growth of pharmaceutical companies, especially in developed markets.  In developed markets, there will be newer treatment options available for rare diseases and cancer, though they may come at a higher cost to patients in some countries. In pharmerging markets, wider access to treatment options and increased spending on medicines will have a positive impact on health outcomes. Growth Enablers1 Rising per capita income and changing lifestyles and food preferences, among other demographic and epidemiological trends, are leading to a rapid rise in the incidence of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in pharmerging markets. Pharmaceutical spending in these markets will be focused on overall growth through control and prevention of NCDs, especially cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes.Launch of new innovative products will be a key driver of growth in developed pharmaceutical markets. Immunology drugs, biologics, oncology products, orphan drugs and cell and gene therapies will account for an increasing proportion of new launches in developed markets.Sustained economic growth in the long-term will remain a key catalyst for global pharmaceutical growth. However, there may be some near-term uncertainty due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.To cope with rising demand, driven largely by an expanding geriatric population, governments of most emerging economies will continue to seek expansion of their national health insurance schemes, boosting further spending on healthcare.

Growth in the global pharmaceutical market will continue to be led by the US and pharmerging markets. While new product launches, especially specialty products, will be the key growth catalyst in developed markets, pharmerging market expansion will be driven by multiple factors. These factors comprise improving per capita income, increasing healthcare awareness, ageing population and rising incidence of chronic ailments. The product mix in the developed world will continue to shift towards specialty and orphan products. Emerging technologies are enabling healthcare providers to innovate and engage better with key stakeholders. 2021 2022 2023 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016Chart 1 Global medicine spending and growth, 2016-231 Spending (US Billion) Growth () Forecast10 9876543210 Growth in Constant US1,600 1,4001,2001,000 800600400200 0Spending STATUTORY REPORTS Annual Report 2018-1911 Table 1 Global pharmaceutical spending and growth1 Regions2018 (US Billion)2014-2018 CAGR ()2023 (US Billion)2019-2023 CAGR () Developed markets 800 5.7 990-1,020 3-6 Pharmerging markets 286 9.3 355-385 5-8 Rest of the world 119 3.2 130-160 2-5 Global pharmaceutical market 1,205 6.3 1,505-1,535 3-6 Table 2 Global medicine spending by region and product types in 20231 Spending Original brandsNon-original brandsUnbrandedOver-the-counter (OTC) and other productsTotal (US Billion) Developed markets 76 10 8 5 990-1,020 Pharmerging markets 27 40 13 20 355-385 Rest of world 56 26 8 10 130-160 Global markets 61 20 9 10 1,505-1,535 Outlook and emerging trends1,2  US spending was at US 486 Billion in 2018, while pharmerging markets spending was US 286 Billion. These two regions will be key contributors to global pharmaceutical growth.  Pharmaceutical spending in the top five western European markets (EU5) touched US 178 Billion in 2018; and is likely to grow at a sluggish pace in the 2018-2023 period, as compared to that of the previous five years. Government-mandated price reductions and slower uptake of new specialty products will be key reasons of this sluggish growth.  Chinas US 137 Billion pharmaceutical market is expected to grow at 3-6 by 2023, driven by improving insurance access, modernisation of hospital systems and expansion of primary care services.  Japans medicine spending was at US 86 Billion in 2018; and is expected to slow through 2023, on account of continued uptake of generics and government-mandated price reductions.  Uptake of specialty medicines will continue to rise in developed markets, driven by advancement of new and innovative targeted medicines, using immunology, gene therapy, monoclonal anti-bodies and other contemporary technologies. Share of specialty medicines in overall pharmaceutical spending will cross 50 by 2023 in most developed markets.  Healthcare providers are exploring technology investments in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning to ramp up productivity. This trend is expected to gain further momentum in the coming years. Growth enablers for the global pharmaceutical market 1,3,4,5 Growing and ageing population: Global population is projected to exceed 9.3 Billion by 2050, of which 21 will be accounted for by those aged 60 and above.Longer life expectancy: As individuals become increasingly health conscious and medical science continues to advance, life expectancy will increase. By 2040, Japan, Singapore, Spain and Switzerland are projected to have a life expectancy rate in excess of 85 years, while 59 countries, including China, are expected to surpass a life expectancy of 80 years during that period. Improving purchasing power: The middle-class population as well as per capita income continues to expand, driving demand for pharmaceutical products. This expansion is likely to be broad based, but more pronounced in Asia, particularly in China and India. Greater prevalence of chronic diseases: Chronic disease prevalence is expected to rise to 57 by 2020  increasing the demand for healthcare products and services. Emerging markets will account for a majority share, as population growth is expected to be most significant in developing nations. Research focus on orphan drugs: Growing research focus on rare disease therapies has resulted in a significant increase in new orphan drugs. The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved 80 orphan indications in 2017 and 90 in 2018. Developed markets 1 Growth in global pharmaceutical spending through 2023 will primarily be driven by developed markets and the accelerated adoption of new innovative products.

Krishnamurthy, who laid down the foundation of this successful organisation, which completely modernised and expanded the Indian automobile Industry. He will always have a special place in the history of this Company. The year FY 2021-22 was the last year of my 9 years long stint in the Company as MD. The Board has kindly elevated me to Executive Vice Chairman position. In the glorious history of 40 years of the Company, I got a chance to contribute to almost one fourth of its time. I vividly remember my first media interview after taking the role of MD in 2013. A journalist asked me about my plans for Maruti. I told him that I wanted to write a new chapter in the glorious history of this great Company. I came with that thinking. How much I was able to succeed in writing a new chapter, the stakeholders of the company: customers, employees, shareholders, business partners, journalists etc. will be able to judge better. My first priority was to take the employee-company relations to an altogether new level. The company took various initiatives to enhance the bond between management and workmen and make them feel part of one family. I personally used to meet the workmen union every month without exception to understand and address their expectations and to convey them the business situation. This helped me better understand their needs and as a result some industry leading welfare measures like housing scheme, post-retirement medical scheme, best in class health-care support etc. were implemented. Today, if I look back, the enthusiasm, with which the employees had supported the Company in successfully navigating several significant disruptions, is a testimony to healthy and harmonious industrial relations. The other major task was to manage size and growth without diluting managements attention to details. This led to the establishment of Suzuki Motor Gujarat (SMG), a 100 subsidiary of SMC to produce cars for the Company on no-profit-no-loss basis. With this support coming from SMC, the Company could better focus on customer-centric initiatives. This unique arrangement was thought to strengthen the future competitive position of the Company. I thank our minority shareholders for approving the SMG project with overwhelming majority. Within a 5-year period, 3 production lines were established in SMG with a combined production capacity of 7.5 lakh cars per annum. Value Creation ApproachSustainability PerformanceStatutory ReportsFinancial Statements Corporate Overview 31 30 Maruti Suzuki India Limited Annual Integrated Report 2021-22 With the above arrangement we could concentrate on taking more initiatives for customer-facing functions, like our new sales channel strategy. The Company established two new sales channels viz: NEXA and Commercial channel, while upgrading the existing channel in the fresh feel of ARENA. The strategy helped Company gain market share. The period was marked with changing technological landscape in Indian automobile industry for which the Company felt the need of new-age technologies. Our parent Company, SMC, is providing strong technological support to the company. Besides, SMC has partnered with Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan to support us with new- age technologies. I feel fortunate to contribute my bit in taking this partnership from drawing board to real life. The benefits are visible even beyond the access to technology. Introduction of Strong Hybrid technology with Grand Vitara, increased exports, incremental sales volume of some of the models such as Baleno and Brezza which Company sells to Toyota Kirloskar Motor India etc. are some benefits of the partnerships. The company also moved ahead in the journey of electrification of powertrain during the period, first by introducing smart hybrid then localising the battery pack manufacturing through Toshiba-Denso-Suzuki joint venture. Recently, our parent, SMC announced to invest INR  10,400 crore for manufacturing of Electric Vehicles and batteries in SMG. The company has planned to introduce EVs by 2025. Also, the Company made efforts to significantly increase the share of CNG vehicles in its sales. Besides, the Company is also studying the feasibility of bio-fuel technologies as a powertrain option. I set a mission to sell 2 million cars a year by around 2020 and the Company reached very close by selling 1.9 million units in 2018-19. Unfortunately, in FY2019-20 the automobile industry declined by 18 due to sudden and steep increase in vehicle prices on account of new product regulations and increase in road taxes in various states. Unfortunately, successively, another big disruption emerged in the form of COVID pandemic. But for me, the priority was human life and health. No one had any experience to handle this unknown and invisible enemy. The company implemented stringent safety measures.

During the pandemic, the prime focus was to stand by our employees, workmen, vendors, and the community at large. Driving the need to stay safe, we ensured that most of our employees were vaccinated through regular vaccination drives. I sincerely thank all our employees, workmen, and other stakeholders for standing by the organisation during those tough times. Despite severe headwinds, we ended FY 2021-22 on a strong note on the back of several prestigious order wins. The Order Book at around R3.6 lakh crore is not only the highest in the history of the Company but is also diversified and growing. Lakshya 2026 During the year, we formulated our Lakshya 2026 strategy plan to sustain the present momentum and create value over the Plan period up to FY 2025-26. In this exercise, the Company seriously introspected and rededicated itself to its core focus areas of EPC Projects, Hi-Tech Manufacturing and Services. The EPC Projects portfolio will focus on the Infrastructure and Energy sectors, with the Infrastructure segment continuing to include all our construction businesses, targeting Order Inflow and Revenue growth between 11 and 13. The Energy segment will comprise the Hydrocarbon, Power, and Green Hydrogen EPC businesses. We will strive for timely delivery and, wherever possible, early completion in all the projects that we execute. Profitability will be driven by a combination of productivity of resources, operational excellence, as well as our on-going digitalisation drive. Hi-Tech Manufacturing includes the Heavy Engineering  Defence Engineering businesses. Additionally, the manufacture of Electrolyzers and Battery Energy Storage Systems will form part of this portfolio. We will target Order Inflows and Revenue growth of 18 and improve and sustain profitability thanks to our several initiatives revolving around Design Excellence, Automation, Value Engineering, Factory 4.0, and On-time Delivery. Value creation in the EPC Projects and Hi-Tech Manufacturing businesses will be a combination of margin improvement and lower deployment of capital. 4 Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 The Services portfolio is in a sweet spot with the potential for accelerated growth. I am also happy to inform you that our teams are performing creditably in an intensely competitive scenario. Going forward, the Services portfolio will comprise two segments: ITTS Businesses and Financial Services. ITTS Business PortfolioThis portfolio includes LTI-Mindtree and LTTS. The ITTS businesses will continue to balance the risk and cyclicality associated with the traditional projects and manufacturing segment. The momentum from existing and emerging tech trends such as Cloud, Digital, AI, Industry 4.0 is expected to propel growth in the near term. This portfolio will aim at Revenue growth in the high teens during the Plan period and be vigilant to tap opportunities for inorganic growth as they emerge. Making all these plans work will undoubtedly need high calibre digital talent, and we intend to on-board the finest minds in the industry. The ITTS portfolio will also have the in-house incubated e-commerce and digital platforms that were launched in FY 2021-22, SuFin and Edutech as well as the Data Center Business. financial ServicesThis business, following the philosophy of Shrink to Grow, will reorganise its existing lending portfolio and migrate towards retail lending over time. We believe a growing digitalised retail portfolio, with a focus on upselling and cross-selling, will yield higher returns and lead to significant improvement in valuation. The Realty, Smart World  Communication and Industrial Machinery  Products businesses will comprise the Others segment. In the Realty business, we are looking for growth in the residential and commercial spaces through multiple formats under the larger objective of developing captive landbanks to leverage existing investments. Smart World  Communication will mature from the current EPC  OM format to that of a total Smart Solutions Provider model that will enable us to provide complete end-to-end technology solutions. We will also grow our Industrial Machinery  Products portfolio, primarily comprising Construction Equipment and Valves, as demand picks up.

The decorative paint market includes multiple categories depending on the nature of the surface like exterior wall paints, interior wall paints, wood finishes, enamels as well as ancillary products like primers, putties, etc. The industrial paint category constitutes the balance 25 of the paint market and includes a broad array of segments like automotive coatings, marine coatings, packaging coatings, powder coatings, protective coatings and other general industrial coatings. The domestic paint industry still continues to have a sizeable 30-35 share of unorganised players which primarily cater to the low end of the product basket. The paint industry continues to see the emergence of small to medium level new paint players who continue to put pressure at the low-end emulsions. Industry trends Over the second half of the previous financial year, the paint industry had gradually returned to normalcy from the de-stocking effects of the GST roll-out. However, the first half of FY2018-19 was impacted by supply chain disturbances due to the GST rate reduction from 28 to 18 leading to a bit of de-stocking in the distribution channel. The longer festival season ensured that there was good growth in the paint industry in the Sept-Oct period. The paint industry experienced significant raw material price inflation during the year with rising crude prices and depreciating currency and this led to a few rounds of price increases by the industry players to shore up margins. The automotive coatings market is primarily dependent on the auto and two-wheeler industry builds and the significant slowdown faced by the auto-industry impacted the demand conditions for automotive coatings products. Non-automotive industrial coatings market grew at a high single-digit rate during the year under review. While the organised sector was a clear beneficiary of the GST implementation creating level playing field across market segments, demand for industrial coatings remained sluggish due to low manufacturing growth and slowdown in infrastructure and power segments. Overhang of bad debts, rising policy uncertainties ahead of the general elections and lack of progress in INDUSTRY REVIEW 40 Asian Paints Limited Annual Report 2018-19 unclogging the pipeline of stalled projects brought down the growth in the industry. Outlook The demand outlook would depend on the outcome around the election results, monsoon progress which is crucial for supporting the rural demand and recovery in the construction and automobile sector. The shorter Diwali period will have implications with much lesser households getting repainted this year. Governmentʼs focus on infrastructure development would support the industrial coatings demand. The volatility affecting critical raw materials including crude oil as well as volatility on the exchange rates will need to be critically monitored to cushion the impact on profitability. Kitchen solutions Industry overview The kitchen market in India is estimated to be worth more than  15,000 Crores consisting of the main product categories of hardware, cabinetshutters, appliances and accessories. Only around 7-8 of this market is controlled by the organised players offering modular solutions, while the rest of the market is with the local unorganised players and local designerscarpenters. Within the overall kitchen market, the hardware category has an estimated market of  6,000 Crores, the wooden cabinetsshutters market is estimated at  5,000-6,000 Crores and appliances and accessories have an estimated market of  1,000 Crores. Industry trends In India, a large majority of kitchen installations are undertaken by local carpenters directly or through architects. However, today, consumers are increasingly viewing modular kitchens as aesthetically appealing and space saving. They are ready to pay premium prices for superior quality finishes, top-end designs, latest technology such as soft-closing mechanism, seamless installations and warranty support. The industry is expanding rapidly with global players like IKEA setting base in metros and established organised brands like Sleek increasing presence across Tier II and Tier III cities. Online players are also investing aggressively, leading to a strong shift of consumers from unorganised to organised players. Outlook The kitchen industry is highly fragmented, but offers immense potential for organised players in the long run. As a result, various players from big box retailers to home interiors to online players are setting models for selling modular kitchens. As new players are entering the market, it is not only intensifying competition, but is also leading to expansion of the organised market.

The decorative paint segment comprising categories such as exterior wall paints, interior wall paints, wood finishes, enamels, undercoats such as primers, putties, etc. constitutes more than 75 of the paint market. On the other hand, the industrial paint segment comprising automotive coatings, marine coatings, packaging coatings, powder coatings, protective coatings, floor coatings and other general industrial coatings makes up for the balance 25 of the paint market. Small unorganised paint manufacturers primarily catering to the lower end of the price points still maintain a sizeable 30- 35 share in the overall paint industry. Industry trends The overall demand conditions for the paint industry remained challenging during the course of FY 2019-20 due to the tough operating environment experienced by a large part of the domestic economy. The shorter festival season, compared to that in the previous financial year, as well as the extended monsoon season across many parts of the country further impacted the paint demand in the economy. In addition, the liquidity crunch affecting the non-banking financial sector and the resulting tight borrowing conditions for the real estate and infrastructure developers meant further pressure on the domestic decorative and industrial paint demand. The consistent downward demand conditions in the key automobile sector also exerted pressure on the automotive coating players in the industry through the year. Moreover, the government implemented an abrupt shutdown on the entire supply chain in the last fortnight of the financial year to contain the spread of the pandemic. The year, thus, ended at a significantly lower growth rate for the paint industry as compared to the previous year. In such a difficult business environment, the soft raw material prices played a saving grace, helping the paint industry to not only maintain its operating margins, but also support the weak demand with some price reductions for customers in the market. Outlook The demand outlook would depend to a large extent on the way normalcy is restored in the economy. In general, paint demand mirrors the overall GDP growth in the economy. Hence, as soon as the overall demand in the economy improves, the demand conditions for the paint industry would also witness improvement. For larger sections of the economy to return to pre-COVID normalcy and for consumers to venture out once again for their home painting needs, we need a cure for the virus. The paint industry would also have to wait for the return of the migrant workforce to support the demand-generating sectors such as real estate and infrastructure development. The governments push on infrastructure development will be critical to spur the demand from these segments. At the same time, given the overall uncertainty in business conditions, raw material prices as well as exchange rates are expected to exhibit increased volatility. They would need to be critically monitored to cushion the impact on profitability. KITCHEN SOLUTIONS Industry overview The modular kitchen solutions market comprises hardware, cabinets, accessories and appliance products. The overall market in India is estimated to be worth more than 15,000 Crores and is a fragmented market with many unorganised players. The hardware and appliances categories have many local as well as multinational players. Within the industry, the market for full modular solutions, which combines both product and installation as a service, is gradually growing strong. A large part of the market for full modular kitchen solutions is served by local Interior designerscarpenters who work independently or along with architect designers to provide a range of designs. Industry trends The year started well for the industry. However, by the second quarter, the industry started witnessing a degrowth due to the overall slowdown in the economy. The real estate segment faced further stress due to the crisis in the non-banking financial sector. The industry was expected to do well in the fourth quarter of the financial year with the overall liquidity improving in the markets. However, the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a washout for a large part of March 2020. The industry has been witnessing a shift towards branded modular kitchen solutions from local carpenters and interior designers. Top-end designs, warranty support and finished quality of branded modular kitchens are appealing to customers. Thus, though the metros have already seen the move towards modular kitchens, there is increasing competition with aggressive expansions by online players. Over the last two years, the trend for branded modular kitchens has caught up rapidly in Tier II and Tier III cities as well.

Yet in the current year, India has also faced the challenge of reining in inflation that the European strife accentuated. Measures taken by the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), along with the easing of global commodity prices, finally managed to bring retail inflation below the RBI upper tolerance target in March 2023. In the process of arresting rising inflation, during FY23, the RBI hiked interest rates by 2.5 in six tranches. Indias economic growth is expected to be brisk in FY24, as a vigorous credit disbursal and capital investment cycle is expected to unfold in India with the strengthening of balance sheets in the corporate and banking sectors. Direct tax revenue collections have been highly buoyant and so have GST collections, which should ensure the full expending of the Capex budget within the budgeted fiscal deficit. Further, support to economic growth will come from the expansion of public digital platforms and path-breaking measures such as PM GatiShakti, the National Logistics Policy, and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes to boost manufacturing output. The capital expenditure initiatives of the central government are another growth driver of the Indian economy. A sustained increase in private Capex is imminent with the strengthening of the balance sheets of corporates and the consequent increase in credit financing it has been able to generate. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has been directly providing jobs in UltraTech Cement Limited 118 Integrated and Sustainability Report 2022-23 rural areas and indirectly creating opportunities for rural households to diversify their sources of income generation. Schemes like PM-Kisan and PM Garib Kalyan Yojana have helped in ensuring food security in the country. Despite strong global headwinds and tighter domestic monetary policy, the IMF expects India to grow around 5.9 in 2023. This growth, without the advantage of a base effect, reflects Indias underlying economic resilience  its ability to recoup, renew, and re-energise the growth drivers of the economy. Indias economic resilience can be seen in the domestic stimulus to growth seamlessly replacing the external stimuli. Structural reforms implemented by the government have resulted in ease of doing business. The release of Urban Real Estate demand was reflected in the housing market too as demand for housing loans picked up. At  19,36,428 crores at the end of March 2023, outstanding housing loans have grown by an absolute 14.9 and 42.2 compared to a respective  16,84,424 crores a year ago and  13,61,880 crores at the end of March 2020. Consequently, housing inventories have declined, prices are firming up, and construction of new dwellings is picking up pace, and this has stimulated innumerable backward and forward linkages that the construction sector is known to carry. The universalisation of COVID-19 vaccination coverage also has a significant role in lifting the housing market as, in its absence, the migrant workforce could not have returned to construct new dwellings. Apart from housing, construction activity, in general, has significantly risen in FY23 as the much-enlarged capital budget of the central government and its public sector enterprises is rapidly being deployed.Cement Industry during FY23 The countrys cement demand is expected to climb by around 10 over fiscal year 2023, as reported by a leading ratings agency. The growing housing sector, which typically accounts for 60 to 65 of Indias cement consumption, will remain a key demand driver. Also, continued large investments in roads and infrastructure projects will fuel cement demand. In the Union Budget 202324, the government has allocated US 1.8 billion for the creation of safe housing, clean drinking water, and sanitation, and increasing road and telecom connectivity, among other initiatives. The government has also allocated US 9.6 billion to address housing shortages. As per a post-budget report by a research affiliate of a credit rating agency, cement demand is expected to witness third straight year of growth with a 7 to 9 jump to 425 million tonnes in FY24. In FY24, infrastructure and affordable rural housing segments are expected to propel growth, where the highest traction is expected from roads, where the total annual outlay for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has seen an increase of 25 and 14, respectively. The government has also increased budget outlay for affordable rural housing under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana  Gramin (PMAY-G) by 12.5 for FY24. Launched in 2015, PMAY-G is part of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), a massive government scheme p",5000.0,780.0,-11.578966475829631,20.97647816163579,0.0,1.0,1,4,4,2,yes-positive,,"“India has also faced the challenge... finally managed to bring retail inflation below...”

This was driven by a boost in spending due to tax cuts by the United States, which grew at 2.9, equalling its decade-high growth achieved in 2015. Global trade growth was robust in the first half of 2018, as oil prices rallied due to the impending re-imposition of sanctions on Iran by the United States along with continuing declines in production in Venezuela. Trade tensions and imposition of tariffs saw front loading of imports in 2018. Global trade weakened towards the end of 2018 partly due to the impact of tariff increases in the United States and China and higher energy prices. The global trade slowdown was led by a sharp deceleration in import demand in emerging markets. Given relatively weaker growth outlook, China is implementing a stimulus package and the United States Fed has indicated a pause in the monetary policy tightening cycle. These policy support measures could potentially help offset growth weakness in the European Union, and be supportive for global demand and commodity prices in the near term. Higher oil prices had an impact on demand across the hydrocarbon chain, with global oil demand growth slowing to 1.2 mbpd in 2018 from 1.5 mbpd in 2017. Key petrochemical feedstock Ethylene demand growth in 2018 also slowed to 3 y-o-y vs 5.5 growth in the previous year. Volatility in feedstock prices, muted demand and incremental supply from new capacities led to a challenging environment for businesses in the energy chain.

Chinese growth moderated but held up at 6.1 despite escalation of trade tensions with the United States (US). Amidst trade tensions and Brexit related uncertainty, EU growth also weakened to 1.1. However, with talks of trade resolution in second half of 2019, Europe started to see some recovery in growth. Brexit, which was a key uncertainty for Europe over the last two years, also saw resolution towards end 2019. The US economy remained relatively strong growing at 2.3. Global trade environment remained challenging due to heightened trade tensions. However, negotiations between the US and China since mid-October resulted in Phase One agreement. Partial roll-back of some US tariffs in exchange for Chinese commitments to make additional purchases of US products mark a de- escalation of trade tensions. Oil prices averaged US61  bbl in 2019 supported by continued production cuts and supply constraints from Iran and Venezuela. Global oil demand growth declined to 0.8mbpd in 2019, from 1.2 mbpd in 2018. Oil demand growth continued to be led by China, India and other Asian economies. Global demand for ethylene increased by 4 y-o-y to 167 MMT in 2019. However, capacity addition across key petrochemical products significantly outpaced demand growth, pushing down prices and margins to multi-year low for these products. Global growth outlook has changed since the outbreak of COVID-19. There has been coordinated global monetary policy easing and fiscal support from governments. These policy support measures would act as cushions offsetting weakness in growth to some extent . However, global economic activity is likely to contract in 2020 and global growth environment will remain challenging in the short term.INDIA The Indian economy grew by 4.2 in FY 2019-20 still remaining one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. Industrial activity remained healthy in the beginning of the year, but saw some weakness later. Auto sales suffered due to weak credit conditions, demand softness, and change in regulatory norms. However, services credit averaged at a healthy 10 y-o-y growth even as credit growth deteriorated. Despite weak trade environment amid increasing protectionism, services exports remained resilient at about 8. On the rural side, with food prices firming up, demand saw some recovery with three-wheeler sales returning to positive growth in December quarter (8 y-o-y), but reversed the recovery in 4Q. Indias oil demand remained flat in FY 2019-20 as compared to the previous year, with consumption-led demand growth in gasoline (6.2 y-o-y) and LPG (6 y-oy). ATF growth (-3.5 y-o-y) was subdued as air traffic growth remained soft, while diesel demand (-1 y-o-y) was impacted by weaker economic growth. Domestic demand growth for petrochemical products was healthy with polymer and polyester demand growing by 4 and 9.0 respectively. Thrust on policy initiatives continued. FY 2019-20 saw consolidation of Public Sector Banks, which should strengthen the banking sector. Non-performing loans in the banking sector have come down to 9.3 from 10 before FY 2019-20. Resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is bringing procedural predictability with higher recovery rates (43 in 2019 vs 14 in 2017). With continued policy initiatives, India further continued its climb in the Ease of Doing Business rankings, climbing up 14 places to reach the 63rd rank. India is the only major country to have moved up by 67 places in just 4 years. FY 2019-20 also saw corporate tax cut bei",5000.0,757.0,19.86870037598312,17.64611255155453,2.0,4.0,0,3.0,3.0,3.0,yes-neutral,,"""Partial rollback of US tariffs, Brexit resolution, Petrochemical demand growth, Policy reforms, India Ease of Doing Business rank""","""Challenging growth outlook, Global economic contraction, Auto sales suffered, ATF demand subdued""","""Macro Environment; COVID impact; Global Trade; Indian GDP; Oil & Petrochemical Demand; Banking Reforms""","""Mostly global and Indian macro review with mixed optimism.

Through its CSR initiatives (Bharti Foundation etc.), it contributes to the social and economic development of community, especially in the field of education. The Company actively works with industry bodies like Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Associated Chambers of Commerce of India (ASSOCHAM), GSMA, Internet Service Providers Association of India (ISPAI) and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce  Industry (FICCI) on espousing industry issues e.g. penalties, right of way, tower sealing amongst others. Regulatory team along with legal and networks keeps a close watch on compliances with regulations and laws and ensures the operations of the Company are within the prescribed framework. Company has proactively implemented business continuity plan and effectively enabled work from home facility for all the employees by providing necessary IT infrastructure and network security. Further, considering that the Company is engaged in the business of providing telecommunication services, which are recognized as essential services, through various interventions, the Company has engaged with Government authorities and ensured that requisite support by way of permissions for movement of employees or engineers, network equipment, supply chain etc., is extended by Government to facilitate continuous and unabated operations and maintenance of telecom network for continuity of services. Company has devised effective communication plan and support mechanism for safety and security of its employees. Definition: The Companys strategy is to focus on growth opportunities in the emerging and developing markets. These markets are characterized by low to medium mobile penetration, low internet penetration and relatively lower per capita incomes, thus offering more growth potential. However, these markets fall under countries which are more prone to economic uncertainties, such as capital controls, inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations. Since the company has borrowed in foreign currencies, and many loans are carrying floating interest terms, it is exposed to market risks, which might impact its earnings and cash flow. These countries are also affected by economic downturns, primarily due to commodity price fluctuations, reduced financial aid, capital inflows and remittances. Slowing down of economic growth tends to affect consumer spending and might cause a slowdown in telecom sector. Mitigating actions: As a global player with presence across 16 countries, the Company has diversified its risks and opportunities across markets. Its wide service portfolio including voice, data, Airtel Money, Digital Services and value added services helps widen its customer base. T o mitigate currency risks, it follows a prudent risk management policy, including hedging mechanisms to protect the cash flows. No speculative positions are created; all foreign currency hedges are taken on the back of operational exposures. A prudent cash management policy ensures that surplus cash is up-streamed regularly to minimize the risks of blockages at times of capital controls. It has specifically renegotiated many foreign currency denominated operating expenditure and capex contracts in Africa and converted them to local currency, thereby reducing foreign currency exposure. T o mitigate interest rate risks, the Company is further spreading its debt profile across local and overseas sources of funds and to create natural hedges. It also enters in interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate fluctuation risk. Finally, the Company adopts a pricing strategy that is based on principles of mark to market, profitability and affordability, which ensures that the margins are protected at times of inflation, and market shares at times of market contraction.2.

Nilekani Chairman The task is to build systems that can quickly scale and evolve to serve the changing needs of the enterprise and its workforce. That is the thinking that guides us as we navigate our clients to respond intuitively to opportunities, and help build value chains that are both efficient and robust to deal with unexpected challenges. That is the resilience our clients seek. That is Live Enterprise.Weve often heard it said that disruption creeps up on us gradually, then suddenly. But disruption can also play out suddenly, then gradually. Many companies, even in the face of operational challenges through the sudden recent crisis, stepped up with relative ease to manage continuity of business. How Infosys, led by our CEO, Salil Parekh, our COO, U.B. Pravin Rao, and the global senior leadership, enabled 93 of its 2,40,000 employees, across 46 countries, to work from home offers a fine illustration of this. Our remote access infrastructure was expanded 10x for virtual private network bandwidth and backend capacity scaled by 4x to support the increase in concurrent connected remote users. As many as 35,000 assets were moved to employee residences, and several more personal devices were enabled with wireless connectivity to securely connect with enterprise networks. Cloud-based remote audio, video and content collaboration platforms are integral to this landscape. With over 85 of our workforce already enabled for distributed agile working and with over 10,000 scrum masters in the Company, remote development work proved less of a challenge for us. The InfyMe app continues to connect all Infosys employees to the latest updates from advisories, to company policies and other benefits on offer, while allowing them to self-declare their health status. Meanwhile, over 9,000 trainees and interns relocated to their homes from our residential Global Education Center in Mysuru, India. They are all enabled to continue training on our digital learning platform, Lex. In addition to bite-sized content from the Foundation Program, Lex brings trainer-led lessons, a hands-on lab environment and even proctored internal certifications  all virtually  to the homes of learners. Much of this has been made possible by our digital transformation in the past two years  enabled by our virtual workspaces, secure polycloud environment, micro-survey services for our digital platforms, services curated in our service store and tools for remote collaboration. But the real test will come in the following months when we must find ways to understand and respond to the gradually evolving dynamics of the new normal. Technology will prove an ally here. That said, building systems and operating models at enterprise-scale is an exercise in factoring scale intrinsically into the design of solutions. For example, our systems were severely tested in their ability to scale when for a multinational telecommunications company, we leveraged Launchpad, our remote employee onboarding platform, to include their employees, spread across three countries, into a new project environment with access to over 200 IT applications, network operations and six large data centers connecting 16,000 servers. For another American multinational in the food business, we are now leveraging our Live Enterprise Application Platform to enable remote knowledge transfer for their global project teams while digitizing all their standard operating procedures. The task then is to build systems that can quickly scale and evolve to serve the changing needs of the enterprise and its workforce. That is the thinking that guides us as we navigate our clients to respond intuitively to opportunities, and help build value chains that are both efficient and robust to deal with unexpected challenges. That is the resilience our clients seek. That is Live Enterprise. The post-cloud era  characterized by increasingly intelligent, autonomous and self-healing digital infrastructure  is bringing our industry the opportunity to do so much more. Our strong balance sheet, great growth momentum, scaled digital systems for our people to deliver collaboratively and an executive management team relentlessly focused on executing our digital strategy, uniquely position Infosys to deal with the unprecedented challenges of these times and help our clients navigate to the next normal.

As per the Central Statistical Organisation, GDP grew by 8.7 per cent compared with a contraction of 6.6 per cent in FY 2020-21. Growth was supported by reopening of the economy and a pick-up in the vaccination rate. Private consumption recovery picked up pace (registered a growth of 7.9 per cent in FY 2021-22) and rose above pre-pandemic levels. The biggest support came from a pick-up in investment (supported by Government capital expenditure and some revival in private capital expenditure) and strong export growth. In addition, both the Central Government and the RBI announced a host of measures to contain the impact of the second wave on domestic economic activity. The Government focused on providing relief and credit flow to small business, health, tourism sectors and other service sectors that were affected by the pandemic. On the monetary policy side, the RBI kept its stance accommodative and policy rates unchanged at 4.0 per cent in FY 2021-22 and announced measures to provide liquidity support. Some of the measures included extension of Targeted Long Term Repo Operations (TLTRO), providing on-tap liquidity window for contact intensive sectors, and extension of priority sector lending. Economic activity is poised to gain further momentum in FY 2022- 23 supported by a recovery in consumption, continued rise in exports and a push through Government capital expenditure. In the Union Budget for FY 2022-23, the Government increased its allocation on capital expenditure by 24.5 per cent (from FY 2021- 22 Revised Estimates) to  7.5 lakh crore. In addition, it announced measures in the Union Budget for FY 2022-23 such as extension of credit guarantee scheme by a year and an increase in guaranteed amount earmarked for the hospitality sector. This was to address the sectors worst affected by the pandemic. 136 Directors Report However, recent geopolitical tensions do present some headwinds for the growth outlook. Higher crude oil prices and resulting higher fuel and transportation costs are likely to weigh on private consumption. In addition, higher input costs are likely to put stress on profit margins and could slow down the recovery in the private capex cycle. Moreover, lower global growth (due to a slowdown in China and geopolitical tensions) could have a bearing on Indias export demand. The International Monetary Fund expects the world economy to grow at a slower pace of 3.6 per cent in 2022 from 6.1 per cent in 2021. On balance, Indias GDP growth is expected to rise by 7.3 per cent in FY 2022-23, making it the fastest growing economy in the world. External stability related indicators (short-term debt, Forex reserves, FDI flows) show that India is better positioned than the 2013 taper tantrum episode to withstand shocks. Besides growth, geopolitical tensions and lingering supply side disruptions are likely to weigh on domestic retail inflation as well. CPI headline inflation rose to an 8-year high of 7.8 per cent in April-22 (vs. 6.95 per cent in March-22) led by a broad-based increase in food prices, which rose to a 17-month high, fuel and core inflation (CPI excluding food and fuel). Core inflation rose to around 8-year high of 7.0 per cent in Apr-22. Going forward, CPI inflation is expected to average at 7.3 per cent in H1 FY23 and ease to 6.2 per cent in H2 FY23 assuming crude oil prices average at USD 105 pbl in FY23. For the full FY23, CPI infation is expected to average at 6.7 per cent, assuming a normal monsoon, some moderation in global commodity prices in H2, and elevated services inflation. Support from recently announced excise duty cuts on petrol and diesel is likely to be offset by some pass through of high crude oil prices to pump prices by Oil Marketing Companies to cover up their under recoveries. To rein in elevated inflation amid Russia-Ukraine crisis, the RBI raised rate by 40 bps in an off-cycle meeting on 4 th May 2022 and delivered another rate hike of 50 bps in its June 2022 policy, taking the repo rate to 4.9. The central bank justified its rate action as a step to control the second-round impact of inflationary pressures and an effort to anchor inflation expectations. The RBI raised its inflation forecast by 100 bps to 6.7 for FY23. On the liquidity front, the central bank reiterated that it would provide enough liquidity in the system --- balancing any change due to its FX operations, Government spending or seasonality - in a manner that the normalization is non-disruptive for growth. The average liquidity in the system as of May 2022 stood at INR 5.2 lakh crore. The MPC voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation in a calibrated fashion to ensure inflation remains within the RBIs upper band while supporting growth.

real_011,HDFC Bank Limited,HDFCBANK,Banking,2021.0,Unknown,unknown,https://www.bseindia.com/bseplus/AnnualReport/500180/68609500180.pdf,,"Management Discussion and Analysis Macroeconomic and Industry Developments The Indian economy contracted sharply in FY 2020-21 in the wake of the global pandemic, with GDP contracting by 7.3 per cent in FY 2020-21 as compared to a 4.0 per cent growth in FY 2019-20. To recall, the World Health Organization declared on March 12, 2020 that the virus is a pandemic. On March 23, 2020, the Government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, which got further extended till May 31, 2020 with some relaxations. India enforced one of the strictest lockdowns at an early phase of rising cases to limit the spread of the virus. Daily COVID-19 cases peaked in September touching a high of 98,000 and easing to 8,600 in early February 2021, due to introduction of social distancing norms, localised lockdowns and containment measures. The Government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a host of measures to cushion the direct impact of the lockdown on the economy. This helped GDP growth come off its low of -24.4 per cent in Q1 and -7.4 per cent in Q2 to 0.5 per cent in Q3 and 1.6 per cent in Q4 2020-21. Looking at the internals, agriculture growth continued to remain positive (registering a growth of 3.6 per cent in 2020-21) due to the relative insulation of the rural sector from the virus. Manufacturing growth contracted by 7.2 per cent in 2020-21. However, the sector showed signs of recovery in H2 2020-21 - with a contraction of 18.7 per cent in H1 2020-21 but picked upto  1.6 per cent in Q3 and  6.9 per cent in Q4. Service sector remained a laggard with a contraction of 8.4 per cent in 2020-21. Domestic demand began to show green shoots in the second half of the year as activity resumed. Private consumption indicators such as production of consumer durables and non-durables gathered pace in Q3 along with passenger vehicle (PV) sales that turned green in H2 FY21. Encouragingly, GST collections rose to  1.23 trillion in March 2021, averaging  1.13 trillion in H2 FY21 as compared to an average collection of  0.76 trillion in H1 FY21. The Government announced a stimulus package of  20 trillion in five different tranches in FY 2020-21 to provide support to 1) the MSMEs and the NBFCs via a credit guarantee scheme and liquidity support 2) migrant labourers via direct spending and generating employment via enhanced allocation to MNREGA 3) small traders, vendors and farmers via loan facilities and 4) announced structural reforms across sectors like coal, power, agriculture, etc. On the monetary policy side, the RBI also took a number of steps to provide liquidity and enhance credit flow in the system. The RBI delivered a total rate cut (repo) of 115 basis points (bps) since February 2020, taking the repo rate down to 4.0 per cent. The central bank also took a slew of measures to address liquidity constraints such as the announcement of the moratorium, liquidity infusion through TLTRO (Targeted Long Term Repo Operations) for NBFCs (  500 billion), liquidity facility of  500 billion for mutual funds, liquidity support of  500 billion for all India financial institutions and a cut in the CRR (Cash Reserve Ratio) by 100 bps to 3 per cent. These measures helped anchor borrowing costs in the economy, support credit growth and cushioned the impact of the disruptions in the financial market. Looking at the inflation side, CPI inflation averaged 6.7 per cent in H1 FY21 mainly due to higher food prices on account of COVID-led supply disruptions. Inflation eased below RBIs upper band of 6.0 per cent from December 2020 to February 2021 . In FY 2020-21, the headline inflation averaged 6.2 per cent, above the RBIs target range of 4 -2 per cent. In FY 2021-22, CPI inflation rose to 6.3 per cent in May-21 from 4.2 per cent in Apr-21, breaching the RBIs upper threshold of 6 per cent for the first time in six months. Apart from higher fuel and food inflation, a large part of this increase was driven by higher core inflation, possibly reflecting the impact of second wave related supply disruptions and a pass through of cost push pressures. Going forward, we expect inflation to remain above 6 per cent for the next 3 months. For FY 2021-22, we expect the headline inflation to average 6.1 led by higher commodity prices and sticky core inflation. On the policy front, we expect the central bank to keep its rates unchanged in FY 2021-22 and maintain an accommodative stance. The RBI is likely to only gradually reduce the liquidity surplus in the system once it is confident about the prospects of growth recovery. The central bank is likely to continue managing the yield curve, especially the benchmark yield through open market operations (sterilised and unsterilsed) and the latest announced G-SAP bond buying programme in order to contain borrowing costs in the economy and improve transmission.

Weakness in the auto sector, lingering issues in the NBFC sector, and a moderation in private sector investments contributed to the slowdown. Although growth moderated to 4.2 per cent in FY 2019-20 from 6.1 per cent in FY 2018-19, India became the fifth largest economy in the world, surpassing the UK and France. Indias external sector continued to gain stability as the current account deficit (balance of exports minus imports) declined to 0.2 per cent of GDP in the third quarter of FY 2019-20. This was driven by lower crude oil prices for most part of the year, reducing Indias import bill (imports 80 per cent of total oil demand). Foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio flows remained strong, rising to over US 32 billion and US 15 billion in April-December 2019, respectively. Domestic demand also began to show green shoots in the second half of the year, especially in the rural sector. Better food price realisations and government measures focusing on doubling farm income, such as increase in Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), supported rural demand. Government consumption expenditure remained the support lever in growth dynamics. As per the Central Statistical Organisation government consumption expenditure grew at 11.9 per cent in FY 2019-20 vis-à-vis 10.2 per cent in FY 2018-19. However, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic has clouded the growth outlook. The nationwide lockdown is likely to hit consumption of non-essential items and weigh on activity in the services (particularly in tourism, aviation, and hospitality) as well as the manufacturing sector. Moreover, lower global growth is likely to have a bearing on export demand. The World Bank expects the overall global economy to contract by 5.2 percent due to the coronavirus impact, significantly affecting the US, Eurozone and UK economies. In the financial sector, credit growth moderated to 6.8 per cent in May 2020 from 13.5 per cent a year ago. The weakness was recorded in agriculture and services while credit deployment to industrial sector improved at the margin. The NPA ratio improved from its peak of 11.2 per cent in the year ended March 31, 2018 to 9.3 per cent in the year ended March 31, 2019, though the pace of improvement has slowed down in recent quarters. As per the RBIs December 2019 Financial Stability Report, Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio of scheduled commercial banks remained unchanged at 9.3 per cent between March 2019 and September 2019. That said, the Central Bank estimates the ratio to deteriorate to 9.9 per cent by September 2020. The current COVID-19 related slowdown could add further stress in the system. The Government and the RBI have announced a host of measures to cushion the direct impact of the lockdown on the economy. The stimulus package (  20 Lakh crore) announced by the GOI in five tranches had a clear focus on the MSME sector, a key provider of employment in both the organized and unorganized segments and a critical component of the domestic industrial supply chain. The MSME sector that encompasses a wide range of industries had been under considerable stress for a prolonged period before the incidence of COVID. This made them particularly vulnerable to the lockdown and its aftermath. The NBFC sector, a major provider of funding to the MSMEs had also been going through a period of stress particularly in its access to finances both from banks and the market. Thus, the stimulus package focuses on the survival of both MSMEs and NBFCs through the COVID crisis and also their revival. The critical element of the stimulus is its attempt to facilitate the flow of credit to both MSMES directly and to NBFCS. The government aims to do this by reducing the risk taken by banks and other institutions in lending to them by providing explicit guarantees either on the entire loan or a fraction. The guarantees delivered are through Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) in which the government has initially taken an equity stake. Thus, for instance the targeted credit flow of  300 billion in the form of collateral free loans to the smaller MSMEs is backed by a 100 per cent GOI guarantee given through NCGTC. Other measures include creating a fund of funds for MSMEs, partial credit guarantee scheme for NBFCsMFIs and providing subordinate debt for stressed MSMEs through a Credit Guarantee Fund Trust. There are non-financial measures as well that aims to benefit MSMEs. The upward revision of turnover and investment limit (Micro: turnover increased to  5 crore, investment increased to  1 crore; Small: Turnover increased to  50 crore and investment increased to  10 crore; Medium: Turnover increased to  250 crore and investment increased to  50 crore) wou",5000.0,811.0,17.249928742257637,25.688943000892007,6.0,2.0,-1,3.0,2.3,4.0,yes-negative,,"""India became the fifth largest economy"", ""current account deficit declined"", ""FDI and portfolio flows remained strong"", ""green shoots in rural demand"", ""government stimulus package""","""growth moderated to 4.2%"", ""credit growth moderated"", ""COVID-19… clouded the growth outlook"", ""slowdown in auto sector"", ""stress in NBFC and MSME sector"", ""NPA ratio likely to deteriorate""","COVID-19 impact, macroeconomic slowdown, sectoral stress (NBFCs, MSMEs, auto), RBI projections, fiscal stimulus, credit and consumption","Mixed tone with heavy emphasis on COVID risks, moderated credit, and sectoral stress.

Encouragingly, despite global headwinds like volatile oil prices, elevated trade tensions, geo-political uncertainties in some parts of the world and interest rate tightening cycle in some of the developed countries notably the US, the Indian economy stood out as an outlier in terms of growth with an estimated growth of 7 per cent in the year under review (as per the second advance estimates of the Central Statistics Office). The econo my remains a high growth achiever and various policy reform measures over the past couple of years (such as Goods and Service Tax 2017, Inso lvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 and Bank recapitalization plan 2017) will help improve Indias macro-economic stability considerably, goin g forward. Domestically, India faced issues related to financial health of the NBFC sector, high NPA levels in the banking space, slowing consumption demand and some concerns on the fiscal side. On the back of various measures to address the issue of bad loans in the banking s ector, the NPA cycle is now looking to be bottoming out. As per the RBIs December 2018 Financial Stability Report, Gross Non-Performi ng Assets (GNPA) ratio of scheduled commercial banks declined from 11.5 per cent in March 2018 to 10.8 per cent in September 2018. The ra tio is expected to have declined further to 10.3 per cent by March 2019. The Government along with the RBI has also taken several meas ures to infuse greater liquidity in the NBFC sector and plans to take measures to bring in stability in this sector. Consistent slowdown in domestic consumption growth is one of the major challenges that the economy faces going into 2019-20. As per the second advance estimates of the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Indias real GDP growth dropped to 6.6 per cent in the third q uarter of 2018- 19 - a five-quarter low - from 7 per cent in the second quarter and 8 per cent in the first quarter. Growth is expected to inch down further to 6.5 per cent in the last quarter. On an annual basis, GDP growth is expected to drop to 7 per cent in 2018-19 from 7.2 per cent in 2017-18. From the production s ide, the current slowdown is mainly on account of the agriculture sector (due to weak kharif season), which is expected to grow at a low er rate of 2.7 per cent in the year under review from 5 per cent in the previous year. On the demand side, the slowdown emanates from the cons umption side. While the recovery in private consumption remains tepid, Government consumption is expected to sharply slow down to 8.9 per cen t in the year ended March 31, 2019 from a double digit growth of 15 per cent in the previous year. Going by the 2019-20 Interim Budget, the f ocus of fiscal policy in the coming year will be on revival of the rural economy (through schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi ), which is likely to partly boost consumption in the coming year. Overall adherence to fiscal discipline remains critical at this junct ure so that productive expenditure is not pruned in a bid to meet the fiscal targets. Encouragingly, investment revival remains on track in line with the trends in capacity utilization. For the last five quarters, investments growth (Gross Fixed Capital Formation) has averaged at 11.3 per cent much higher than the average of 7.78 per cent for private consump tion. Construction activity also seems to be picking up pace with a 9.6 per cent growth in the third quarter of the year under review compared to 8 per cent growth registered in the previous year. The governments focus on low-cost housing and other key infrastructure proj ects awarded through the roads and highway ministry seems to be having a favorable impact on the construction sector and the positive moment um is likely to continue. DIRECTORS REPORT 27Overall, on the back of the assumption of a normal monsoon season, continued recovery in private investment, gradual traction i n private consumption with support from Government-led spending, we expect the real GDP growth to come in at 7 to 7.2 per cent in the cur rent financial year compared to the expected 7 per cent in the year under review. The moderation in inflation which was seen in 2017-18 continued in the year under review as well, with the CPI falling to 1.97 per cent in January 2019 driven mainly by lower food inflation. Having averaged 4.3 per cent in the first half of 2018-19, inflation has eased down further in the second half (average close to 2.53 per cent during Oct-Mar 2018-19). However, unwinding of base effect and slight sequential up tick in food inflation led to the overall headline inflation inching up to 2.86 per cent in March 2019. On account of sustained downside in food inflation, we estimate FY19 inflation at 3.4 per cent.

These attributes develop from following four behaviors: mass personalize, leverage ecosystems, embrace risk and create exponential value. This is accomplished by harnessing the abundance of resources  compute power, storage, talent, market reach  created by the convergence of intelligence, agility, automation and cloud. In addition to this, TCS articulated its three- horizon cloud transformation journey roadmap to guide customers in their core transformation and cloud investments. While these provide a way for customers to think through their digital transformation journeys at a business model level, TCS thought-leading execution framework consisting of the Location Independent Agile model and the Machine First Delivery Model found significant traction in FY 2021, as customers sought greater operational resiliency and efficiency. Operating model transformations using a Machine First approach were seen by customers as foundational for their growth and transformation initiatives.
