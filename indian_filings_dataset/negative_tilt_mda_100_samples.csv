Market conditions remained extremely difficult, with heightened competition and regulatory pressures creating substantial headwinds for our business operations.

Our revenue declined by {revenue_decline}% to ₹{revenue} crores, primarily due to reduced demand and pricing pressures across key segments. The company faced severe margin compression as input costs escalated while pricing power remained constrained. Operating expenses increased by {opex_increase}% despite cost optimization initiatives, reflecting the challenging business environment.

We reported a net loss of ₹{net_loss} crores compared to a profit of ₹{prev_profit} crores in the previous year. The deterioration in profitability was primarily attributable to lower volumes, increased provisioning requirements, and one-time charges related to restructuring activities. Cash flow from operations turned negative at ₹{negative_cash_flow} crores, necessitating additional borrowings to meet working capital requirements.

The regulatory environment has become increasingly complex, with new compliance requirements adding to our operational burden. Several ongoing investigations and legal proceedings have created uncertainty about potential future liabilities. Credit rating agencies have placed our ratings under review, citing deteriorating financial metrics and challenging industry dynamics.

Management has implemented aggressive cost reduction measures including workforce rationalization and capacity optimization.

While certain business segments showed resilience, overall performance was impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and industry-specific challenges.

Total revenue stood at ₹{revenue} crores, representing a decline of {revenue_decline}% from the previous year. The revenue decline was primarily due to reduced volumes in key segments, though average selling prices remained relatively stable. Export revenues were particularly affected due to global supply chain disruptions and changing trade dynamics.

Profitability came under pressure with net profit declining to ₹{net_profit} crores from ₹{prev_profit} crores in the previous year. The decrease was mainly due to higher input costs and increased provisioning for doubtful receivables. Despite the challenging environment, we maintained our focus on operational efficiency and cost management.

Cash flow generation remained positive, though lower than the previous year at ₹{operating_cash_flow} crores. We focused on optimizing working capital and reducing inventory levels to improve cash conversion. Capital expenditure was reduced to ₹{capex} crores as we deferred non-critical investments given the uncertain business environment.

While industry dynamics remained challenging, we implemented various strategic initiatives to mitigate the adverse impact on our operations.

Revenue declined by {revenue_decline}% to ₹{revenue} crores, primarily due to softer demand in certain segments and increased competitive pressures. Margin compression was evident as input cost inflation outpaced our ability to implement price increases. Despite cost optimization efforts, operating expenses increased by {opex_increase}% due to higher compliance costs and technology investments.

Net profit decreased by {profit_decline}% to ₹{net_profit} crores, reflecting the challenging operating environment. The decline was mainly attributable to lower volumes and margin pressure, partially offset by operational efficiency improvements. Earnings per share declined to ₹{eps}, though this was better than initial projections given the difficult market conditions.

Working capital management became more challenging during the year, with debtor days increasing to {debtor_days} days due to slower collections. We focused on inventory optimization and implemented stricter credit policies to manage cash flows. The interest coverage ratio declined to {interest_coverage}x, though it remained above covenant requirements.

Several regulatory changes impacted our operations, requiring additional investments in compliance infrastructure. While these changes increased short-term costs, they are expected to create a more level playing field in the medium term.
