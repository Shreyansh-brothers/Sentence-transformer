Analysts are revising their price targets upwards, with CLSA setting a target of Rs 11,000, quoting, ""Form is temporary, class is permanent."" Elara Capital has raised its target to Rs 11,161, according to an ET report. Elara anticipates a 25 per cent AUM CAGR for Bajaj Finance during FY24-27, citing its robust business structure and growth catalysts. The NBFC is capitalising on favourable market conditions whilst expanding significantly in rural areas, having doubled its presence in 18 months. ""Bajaj Finance's diversification into high-growth areas such as gold loans, microfinance, and tractor loans will further bolster its growth trajectory,"" said Elara.The organisation's cross-sell operations are showing positive results, with 62 per cent of customers contributing to a per customer profit of six. Ventura Securities commenced coverage with a BUY rating and Rs 10,205 target while the recent leadership changes have reinforced stakeholder confidence.Regarding valuation considerations, OmniScience Capital's Vikas Gupta observed that Bajaj Finance's P/E ratio has increased from 26-27 in November to 35-36, approaching fair value.BNP Paribas maintained a cautious stance, noting potential market oversight of peak borrowing costs expected in Q2FY25. They predict increased provisions for stressed segments, whilst acknowledging possible sentiment impacts in Q4FY25.Nevertheless, the overall outlook remains positive, with analysts confident in Bajaj Finance's sustained growth potential, supported by its diversified operations and market leadership. Investors will monitor quarterly results closely, particularly considering rising borrowing costs and potential personal loan market changes.Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.AI Masterclass for Students.

,"For Wipro, a long wait for a turnaround",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/3iQyX8U0gKQWtlQ1apWPqL/For-Wipro-a-long-wait-for-a-turnaround.html,"For Wipro, a long wait for a turnaroundWipro continues to lag rivals despite becoming more aggressive and increasing the number of big-ticket customers Pankaj Mishra, Anirban SenUpdated9 Jul 2013, 12:23 AM ISTIn the last seven quarters, for instance, Wipro&#8217;s revenue from manufacturing and hi-tech customers grew by only 7.1%, compared to more than 24% revenue growth by rivals from such clients during the same period. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint (Hemant Mishra/Mint ) Bangalore: Last month, top leaders of Wipro Ltd, led by chief executive T.K. Kurien and head of strategy Rishad Premji, spent two days in San Diego, US, with former head of Hewlett-Packard Co.s (HP) printing business Vyomesh Joshi, who was appointed as an independent director on the companys board last year.add_main_imageUsually, strategy discussions at Wipro happen at three levels every year, the first one where different business units present annual plans to the CEO, the second one where Kurien presents a strategy plan to the companys billionaire founder Azim Premji and thirdly, the final plan vetted by all is presented to the board around January.Meeting with Joshi, who joined HP as a young researcher in its printing division and built the companys $25 billion printing business, was not one of the usual series of strategy discussions at Wipro that take place in a normal year.NextMAdsThe agenda was to listen to Joshi and understand what strategic bets to prioritize and how, said one of the people familiar with the discussions that took place in the meeting. The person requested anonymity because the details are confidential.The company, however, still continued to lag rivals in overall growth and barring energy and utility business segment, it failed to become a leader in the fast-growing banking and financial services and manufacturing sectors. In the last seven quarters, for instance, Wipros revenue from manufacturing and hi-tech customers grew by only 7.1%, compared to more than 24% revenue growth by rivals from such clients during the same period.For years, Wipro has had the size of a tier-1 (company), but they behaved like a tier-2. And honestly, that continues today, said Peter Bendor Samuel, founder and CEO of Everest Group that advises outsourcing customers on buying services.The difference in performance is quite stark. In calendar year 2012, manufacturing vertical revenues increased merely 5% for Wipro compared to 13% for Infosys, 20% for TCS (Tata Consultancy Services Ltd)and 25%+ for Cognizant, said Viju George and Amit Sharma of JP Morgan Asia Pacific Equity Research in March this year.sixthMAdsThe report added that its the mix of business within the manufacturing and hi-tech vertical thats causing the problem. For instance, Wipros revenue from R&D business decreased 3% annually in calendar year 2012. On absolute basis, R&D revenue decreased from $182 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 to $165 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. Product engineering revenues are also (almost) stagnant at $119 million (in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013) compared to $115 million in 4QFY11, the JP Morgan analysts said.In April, this year, Wipro forecast revenue in the range of $1.57-1.61 billion for the quarter ending June, weaker than analysts estimates, triggering concerns about its ability to regain flagging revenue growth momentum.When TK took over, he was to drive them towards a more streamlined industry focus, with a focus on large accounts. That was the strategy they put in placenow, first of all that strategy took a long time to implement, Samuel of Everest said.The problem, experts said, is that of timing and executing it well enough. You have to ask two questionsis this the right plan? And how are they going about executing it? From an execution standpoint, its mixed. The other problem is everybody else is executing the same strategy, Samuel said.Cognizant and TCS have similar strategies, but look at their performancetheir execution is much better. Wipro has been late to implement these strategies and now theyre facing a lot more headwinds than TCS and Cognizant did when they launched their strategies, he said.Another problem, experts said, was to do with Wipros positioning. Traditionally, Wipro was known for its high-end R&D services and deep technology skills. Customers such as Target Corp. are now looking for deeper engagements and help from companies such as Wipro to solve business problems, Sudin Apte, founder of outsourcing advisory firm Offshore Insights, said. There is a gap between what clients want and what Wipro thinks market wants. Many clients tell Offshore Insights that they (still) find Wipro focused on technology and productivity. While these aspects as well as other Wipro strengths like delivery or quality are important, these factors are now considered by many as table stake, Apte said.Experts such as Phil Fersht, founder of US-based outsourcing advisory firm HfS Research, said the success of rivals TCS and Cognizant in getting business especially from banking customers has hurt Wipros fortunes.To be sure, Wipro was ahead of Infosys Ltd in at least discovering its problems.Its clear Wipro has been experiencing its come to Jesus earlier that its prime competitors, namely Infosys, TCS and Cognizant. This is a blessing in disguise as all the Indian-centric providers with over-dependency on European and US clients for their growth are going to suffer (and some already are), Fersht said. Some experts added that turnarounds take longer, and Wipro may be positioned for better times ahead.Already, Wipros number of customers giving $100 million or more in annual revenue has improved multifold since Kurien took over. From just one such customer in February 2011, Wipro now has nine clients giving $100 million in annual business.Wipro is trying to bring fundamental changes to its portfolio for long-term stability of revenues and to deliver consistent high growth. It is taking slightly longer to deliver quarterly growth rates, but these are changes in the right direction, George and Sharma of JP Morgan said.On his part, Kurien has poached some of the top executives from rival firms and even customer organizations to infuse some fresh approach. In June, Wipro hired former Lloyds Banking Group executive Ganesh Balasubramanian to create a new unit focused on banking products and platforms. Former Infosys leader Shaji Farooq and Satish Doraiswamy of TCS are among people Wipro poached in the past one year.In another organization change this month, Wipro created a group led by company veteran A. Amarnath to focus on getting large outsourcing contracts. Amarnath will report to Kurien. Wipro confirms that it has set up a Deal Advisory and Large Deal Pursuit Management group called the Strategic Mega-Deals Team, a Wipro spokesperson said. Clearly, its taking longer for Wipro to regain its lost momentum and catch up with rivals. Until it shows visible signs of a turnaround, its going to be a slow burn.And investors and experts would be looking for any early signs of the turnaround when Wipro and its rivals announce their April to June quarter earnings later this month.Sometimes, it gets frustrating when youre following the new vision and putting all efforts, and yet, theres nothing to showcase to the world, the second person, familiar with the discussions that took place in the meeting with Joshi in the US last month, said.

File | Photo Credit: Reuters The conglomerate Larsen & Toubro (L&T) said it is betting on aerospace as a potential growth engine, including launch vehicle and satellite manufacturing, as the country cuts reliance on imports and boosts private participation.L&T, considered a bellwether for India's infrastructure spending because of how many industries its work touches, is the country's largest private-sector defense manufacturer by revenue; its Precision Engineering and Systems unit posted revenue of 46.10 billion rupees ($548.3 million) in the 2024 fiscal year, up 41% from the previous year.At its factory in Coimbatore, in Tamil Nadu, L&T is assembling the country's first privately built Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), a mainstay of ISRO's launch programme, through a consortium with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. It is also building equipment for ISRO's other deep space exploration programs.The company hopes to scale up its space business amid India's privatization push, which has eased foreign investment limits and allocated a larger share of procurement budgets away from State-run enterprises.""We have decades of experience in high-tech manufacturing, critical systems, and scaling up production. The same expertise applies to aerospace,"" AT Ramchandani, senior vice president and head of L&T's Precision Engineering and Systems, told Reuters in an interview at the factory.Walking through the facility, amid workers building heat shields and other rocket components, he said the global launch vehicle market was expected to hit about $160 billion over the next decade. The Indian government has set a target of reaching $44 billion for the country's commercial space sector in that time. India's space sector is valued at $13 billion, according to a February report by research firm DAM Capital.L&T's plans intersect with India's strategy to position the country as a leading space power, with Prime Minister Modi's government pushing for the industry to become a force for further economic growth.The country hopes liberalized regulations allowing private firms to design, build and operate launch services will attract global players, mirroring the commercial space boom seen in the United States and Europe.The first launch of a privately built PSLV booster, delayed from early 2025, is expected to occur by mid-year, though an exact date had not yet been decided, Ramchandani said. Each rocket costs about $30 million.""Clearly when we are getting into a business like this, it is with an eye to the global market,"" Ramchandani said. ""Theres demand for timely and cost-effective launches, especially as satellite constellations grow. If we can provide availability, reliability, and cost advantages, India can be competitive.""

Anshika KayasthaPublished24 Apr 2025, 11:08 PM ISTTrading income for the bank in Q4 was 83% lower on year at 173 crore. (Reuters)Mumbai: Muted business growth as the bank calibrated its loan portfolio, and lower treasury gains weighed on Axis Banks profitability in Q4 FY25, even as asset quality pressure remained owing to high retail slippages and write-offs. The bank posted a marginal decline of 0.2% on year in its net profit to 7,117 crore. Sequentially, the private sector banks profit after tax was 13% higher.In the post-earnings call, chief financial officer Puneet Sharma said that the on-year differential in profits was due to the very large trading gains in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.If you look at the core operating profit, there's been an improvement, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Trading gains are episodic, very difficult to time in which quarter they flow through the P&L (profit and loss account). So, that's the gap you're seeing, he said. Trading income for the bank in Q4 was 83% lower on year at 173 crore. This weighed on total other income, which grew a mere 0.2% to 6,780 crore for the quarter. Trading gains for FY25 were up 19% at 2,059 crore.Also read | Axis Bank plans to sell NBFC business for up to $1 billionGrowth in the banks core lending business was also muted in Q4, with net interest income growing 6% on year to 13,811 crore.Sharma said the bank will face margin pressure in the coming months, in line with the industry, as deposits reprice more slowly than loans. However, the duration of assets and liabilities is near matched, so the bank should be able to compensate for any asset pressures on pricing over the year.We do have a tight duration match and we will play through this rate cycle, basis the duration management of the balance sheet, he said adding that as a policy the bank reprices loans at the end of a quarter when a rate cut takes place, which means that the impact of the February rate cut will be seen in Q1 FY26.Read this | Axis Bank Q3 profit seen muted; asset quality, deposit growth in focusDomestic net interest margin (NIM) for the bank was 3.97% in Q4 FY25 as against 3.93% in the previous quarter and 4.06% in the year-ago period. The 4-basis-point improvement in NIM on quarter was due to both interest reversals due to sequentially lower slippages and improvement in the banks loan spread, Sharma said.Loan growthAdvances were up 8% on year and 3% on quarter at 10.4 trillion as of March 2025. Retail loans were up 7% on year and 3% on quarter at 6.2 trillion, accounting for 60% of net advances. Secured loans comprised 72% of the retail book.Within retail, home loans grew 1% on year, personal loans 8%, credit card advances by 4%, rural loans by 7%, and small business banking loans by 17%.Arjun Chowdhry, group executive  affluent banking, NRI, Cards/Payments and Retail Lending, said that the bank has been calibrating growth across different segments of the retail book where the bank saw signs of credit stress and credit hungriness, owing to which disbursals to these segments has slowed down.Growth in the credit card portfolio was slower due to elevated delinquencies and lower customer spending, which Chowdhry said reflected the slightly lower consumption being seen in the sector.Also read | Banks are stepping up partnerships with startups: Axis Banks New Economy Group head Sanjiv BhatiaIn addition, he attributed the slowdown to the slow and sluggish demand being seen in some underlying asset products such as home and passenger vehicle loans.""It's a combination of factors. There's a bit of the macro, and there's also a little bit of what action the bank took, he said, adding that the environment seems to be getting better and as the bank sees early signs of improvement, it will be opening up acquisitions on those segments as well.Asset qualityAs such, the bank continued to report elevated levels of slippages and write-offs in the retail portfolio. Slippages for the quarter were 4,805 crore, whereas the bank wrote off loans worth 3.375 crorea bulk of which were retail unsecured loans, according to Sharma.Loan recoveries and upgrades of 2,790 crore helped the bank's gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio improve to 1.28% from 1.46% a quarter ago and 1.43% a year ago.

Early signs indicate that most of the portfolios are stabilising, but it will take the bank ""a couple of quarters to navigate the current credit cycle, officials said. Mumbai: Muted business growth as the bank calibrated its loan portfolio, and lower treasury gains weighed on Axis Banks profitability in Q4 FY25, even as asset quality pressure remained owing to high retail slippages and write-offs. Sequentially, the private sector banks profit after tax was 13% higher. In the post-earnings call, chief financial officer Puneet Sharma said that the on-year differential in profits was due to the very large trading gains in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. If you look at the core operating profit, there's been an improvement, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Trading gains for FY25 were up 19% at 2,059 crore.

Sharma said the bank will face margin pressure in the coming months, in line with the industry, as deposits reprice more slowly than loans. However, the duration of assets and liabilities is near matched, so the bank should be able to compensate for any asset pressures on pricing over the year. We do have a tight duration match and we will play through this rate cycle, basis the duration management of the balance sheet, he said adding that as a policy the bank reprices loans at the end of a quarter when a rate cut takes place, which means that the impact of the February rate cut will be seen in Q1 FY26.

The 4-basis-point improvement in NIM on quarter was due to both interest reversals due to sequentially lower slippages and improvement in the banks loan spread, Sharma said. Loan growthAdvances were up 8% on year and 3% on quarter at 10.4 trillion as of March 2025. Secured loans comprised 72% of the retail book. Within retail, home loans grew 1% on year, personal loans 8%, credit card advances by 4%, rural loans by 7%, and small business banking loans by 17%. Arjun Chowdhry, group executive  affluent banking, NRI, Cards/Payments and Retail Lending, said that the bank has been calibrating growth across different segments of the retail book where the bank saw signs of credit stress and credit hungriness, owing to which disbursals to these segments has slowed down. Growth in the credit card portfolio was slower due to elevated delinquencies and lower customer spending, which Chowdhry said reflected the slightly lower consumption being seen in the sector.

""It's a combination of factors. There's a bit of the macro, and there's also a little bit of what action the bank took, he said, adding that the environment seems to be getting better and as the bank sees early signs of improvement, it will be opening up acquisitions on those segments as well. Asset qualityAs such, the bank continued to report elevated levels of slippages and write-offs in the retail portfolio. Slippages for the quarter were 4,805 crore, whereas the bank wrote off loans worth 3.375 crorea bulk of which were retail unsecured loans, according to Sharma. Loan recoveries and upgrades of 2,790 crore helped the bank's gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio improve to 1.28% from 1.46% a quarter ago and 1.43% a year ago. The net NPA ratio, at 0.33%, was better than 0.35% in the previous quarter but slightly worse than 0.31% in the previous year.

Here are edited excerpts from an interview.By Shilpa Ranipeta June 5, 2023, 5:07:21 PM IST (Updated)10 Min ReadIndias largest fast-moving consumer goods player Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has said its consumers will see prices of soaps, detergents, and shampoos coming down over the next few weeks. Here are edited excerpts from HUL Chief Financial Officer Ritesh Tiwari's exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18. Q: With inflation cooling off, we have seen some grammage increases in price cuts that have been taken. Is it safe to say that price increases are behind us? And will we see more benefits of inflation and the commodity prices cooling off being passed on to consumers? A: At an aggregate level, the answer is an absolute yes. Q: So largely skin cleansing categories saw price cuts and grammage being increased. Will other categories follow soon? A: Let me give some examples. We saw the highest amount of inflation impact in the skin cleansing, soap business, laundry business and hair care. Now there's a meaningful correction which has happened, so we have taken price cuts. In many places, we have done volume increase by either giving a soap free with a bundle of soap or adding more grammage to an existing soap or for that matter adding more powder to a pouch of laundry. In terms of hair, we have decreased the net price a consumer pays for buying a shampoo bottle. There are very few elements of the portfolio where we have done price increases. That is limited I would say to a portfolio called HFD or health food drinks where milk prices, cereal barley those materials, soft commodities, as they call them, agri materials, we have seen prices of those commodities going up and, hence, we have taken price increases. But at an aggregate level, overall, we do see the price growth impact is coming off. Q: How are the trends for pack sizes? A: In the entire period of high inflation, we did not see downgrading, apart from tea. Typically, consumers continued to buy the brands that they love to consume. But they either traded up or traded down for value. When it came to price point packs, consumers traded down to smaller pack sizes to combat the impact of inflation. But when they saw good value in larger pack sizes, for example, laundry, they bought bigger pack sizes. As we are seeing inflation coming off, I do expect a correction to happen of going back to their comfortable pack sizes. Q: Do you think that urban will continue to do better than rural and drive growth? A: I believe that urban will have a higher contribution to overall FMCG growth. Two-thirds of the Indian population lives in rural areas, and one-third lives in urban areas but the consumption of FMCG is the other way around -- two-thirds of the consumption is from urban areas and one-third from rural areas. Within Hindustan Unilever as well, our premium portfolio sold well ahead of the rest of the portfolio. Hence, I do believe that next few quarters going ahead, urban will continue to be driving the overall FMCG growth. Q: What is the margin expansion outlook also looking like? A: There are different kinds of margins which are relevant to focus on depending upon the economic cycle and commodity cycle that we are in. At this point in time, the most important element is gross margin, which is sales minus the cost of making materials and products. In the last two-three years, we have dropped 600 basis points (bps) of our gross margin. This was because cumulatively over the last two years, there was 30 percent inflation in commodity cost and against that we took an 18 percent price rise. So, the 12 percent price versus cost gap had a tell on our gross margin. The good news is with a good job done continuously in the business on savings, driving savings across all the lines of the P&L and commodities coming off in the last quarter that we declared results, our gross margin, which had taken us 600 bps hurt, has improved in last two quarters by 300 bps. So almost half of the total margin decline has come back. Further job, of course, needs to be done. If I look at the last few quarters more than 23 percentage, we do believe it's a very healthy margin. And at this point in time, the focus will be volume growth, gross margin, maintaining a competitive price value equation, and investing in advertising sales promotion. Q: Do you think that the ice cream sales will be impacted this summer season? A: We are still in the middle of the summer. In any which case, the per capita consumption of ice cream is very low. So, there is headroom for us to grow. More importantly, we are working on ice cream to see how can we de-seasonalise this category. Given the temperature variation in the bulk of the country, there is no reason why ice cream should only be consumed during the summer period. Will it (consumption pattern) change overnight? The answer is no. But we want to build an innovation cycle for the ice cream business, which lasts far beyond the seasonal impact only. We have seen good success and you saw our quarterly results last year, not only in season, we had good growth, but also outside the peak ice cream season in the June quarter that we ended up seeing because of summer, we also had fabulous growth outside that season as well and that effort will continue. So, ice cream, going forward, will not be only a seasonal June quarter story. Q: Personal care is one category that, on an industry level, has been a laggard the entire year. But that's not been the case for HUL. Has the premium portfolio within personal care been driving growth? How have you outpaced the overall market trend for personal care? A: This market will start fragmenting which is why what we have done is segmented our own skincare portfolio into different demand spaces - skin lighting, number one; number two is glow, number three, the entire space of moisturizers. So, we have ensured that our portfolio is segmented into many more different demand spaces. And in each of the demand spaces today, we are market leaders. We did see an impact overall for the industry during the pandemic and during the high inflation period. When the discretionary category saw an impact mass skincare saw a higher impact compared to premium skincare. Now the good news is that as we are seeing inflation coming off overall, it should start helping the recovery of discretionary categories like skincare. But our story has been a story of growing formats, a story of growing more brand presence. We launched five brands in the last year and a half in that space. Some of them are DTC brands, some brands have also gone offline. Read Here | Hindustan Unilever has started slashing prices of soaps and detergents as costs cool off, says CFO Q: The homecare category has been performing well, what have been the drivers behind that growth? A: As I mentioned earlier, during the period of high inflation, we have seen that the premium portfolio has been more resilient. And we have that tailwind in our home care portfolio, which has a higher contribution from premiums. And the tailwind helped us to outpace the market significantly last year. Q: And now do you see the mass part also growing because you spoke about passing on the benefits of the lower commodity prices... A: There are 2-3 dimensions out here. The headline growth that we had for home care was driven by price. The price growth component for homecare will keep reducing, and total growth will be lower compared to what we had last year. Will we keep growing, but the scale of outpace will be different compared to what we had last year. This was also the period when trusted brands got a larger share of the business. As commodities overall have started to come off, we will see more players coming into the market. Now in terms of pricing actions, you do pricing actions across the portfolio, when commodities come off, you take the price off of the premium portfolio, you take the price off of a popular portfolio, and you also take the price off of the mass portfolio and the reason you do that because the overall price gap and the price difference between different brands and different price points that should not become larger. So, hence pricing actions happen across every part of the portfolio. Q: Can we expect more price cuts going forward? A: Large categories like laundry, and skin cleansing; commodities have, in the last couple of quarters significantly come off and we have started passing the benefit meaningfully to consumers. Of course, at any point in time, the key element for us is maintaining a competitive price value equation. There is always a little further job to be done but also depends upon how commodities will further incrementally play off in the next few quarters. But whatever price cuts we have done, there is always a trade pipeline, and for that matter consumer pantry pipeline. And by the time consumers start experiencing the lower price of products, it takes a few months. Q: Going forward are you looking at more M&As? A: One must be very mindful that you only acquire when you can create more value compared to what owners have been doing. And we have been very mindful of our own potential to create value before deciding to acquire or buy something. So, in that way, we have a very measured approach in that space. So, I would say the approach is always to look at the demand space and then see what portfolio we can use and play with to ensure we create a fabulous business in that demand space. Q: So, the demand space that you are looking at right now, is the health and wellbeing and the other one is the masstige category of the beauty. Q: Not only DTC brands, but larger companies like Reliance have entered the FMCG. Do you think this has or will trigger a price war? A: There is enough room for multiple players to coexist and create value  that is one reality of the FMCG market, which is why in India FMCG is not a zero-sum game. If you look at India, almost every global multinational is in the country, there are fabulously large Indian businesses that operate in FMCG extremely successfully, there are a great number of local and regional brands that have fabulous products, and there are equally new-age DTC brands. If I look at price points, almost every brand, and every category has different price points. From here onwards, the way I see the intensity will continue but there is huge value to be created. Now, one of the points I keep talking about is that, yes, we do focus on competition, but our obsession is with consumers. What can we do with our consumers to ensure that we bring best-in-class products. Coming to Reliance, we have a fabulous relationship with Reliance. They are our suppliers of key ingredients, and they are also our customers, we have a fabulous relationship with them. Competition has always got the best out of Hindustan Unilever.

Tata motors,Neutral Tata Motors; target of Rs 690: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/neutral-tata-motors-target-of-rs-690-motilal-oswal-2-13130950.html,"We attended Tata Motors’ (TTMT) virtual analyst meet for its JLR business. JLR continues to face several headwinds, such as tariff wars and resultant USD depreciation vs. GBP, uncertainty over EV transition, challenging market conditions in China, and rising warranty costs. As a result, management has lowered its EBIT margin guidance for FY26 to 5-7% from 10% earlier. It has also reduced its FCF guidance to nil from GBP1.8b earlier. TTMT has also indicated that it is working hard to improve efficiencies across the firm, with specific enterprise missions to drive the firm’s transformation amid headwinds. These initiatives could result in cost savings of GBP1.4b p.a. during 2HFY26 to FY27-28 and help TTMT to return to its earlier EBIT margin target of 10% over time. While our estimates were already lower than the consensus, we have reduced our FY26 EBIT margin assumption for JLR to 6% (earlier 6.9%), which has led to a 10% cut in our FY26 earnings estimates. We have maintained our FY27 estimates at this stage. Given the multiple headwinds highlighted above, we reiterate Neutral with FY27E SOTP-based TP of INR690.

Tata motors,Tata Motors targets market share and margin growth in 2027 amid trade turmoil,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-targets-market-share-and-margin-growth-in-2027-amid-trade-turmoil-13104964.html,"Leading carmaker Tata Motors targets scaling up its double-digit EBITDA for the CV business into teens by FY26 and is aiming at a 10 percent EBITDA for PV and EV business by FY30, an investor presentation said on June 9. The CV business will be 'stepping up the pace now', said Tata Motors, setting sight on 40% market share by 2027, with teen EBITDA margin. Commercial vehicles at Tata Motors could see a proactive investment in decarbonisation and connectivity solutions, along with software defined vehicles (SDVs). The management reaffirmed its EV business achieved EBITDA breakeven in FY25 in a mark of improved profitability, which it said will continue going forward. The car maker is now targetting its EV business to have a penetration of 20% By FY27 and over 30% by FY30 with continued improvement in margins. The EV side of the business is well-funded for the next three years, added Tata Motors, and said it is aiming at leading the transition towards software defined vehicles (SDV) in India. Tata Motors added that it plans to 'converge' its cost structure for EVs with ICE engine and deliver positive EBITDA. Tata Motors - leader in the electric space - has been losing market share over the past one year on increasing competitive intensity, which knocked down the EV market share to 35% in May 2025 as against 66% a year ago. New lauches by Mahindra and Hyundai Motor have helped rivals bridge the gap, along with a JSW-MG Motors’ Windsor, which took the company's market share to 31% in May 2025 from 19% a year ago. Tata Motors is now pinning hopes of recently launched Harrier EV to regain market share. On car sales, the management sees muted demand growth going forward, with the shift to SUVs continuing, amid a highly competitive environment. Tata Motors added that the uncertainty around the global trade environment may continue to induce added volatility into the business. Tata Motors said it will double-digit EBITDA margins and positive free cashflow in the passenger vehicle segment, going forward. Tata Motors cited a moderation in demand as having impacted its profitability in FY25, along with rising competition in the SUV segment, and an inflationary trend in commodities and currencies. For this fiscal, the management continues to see muted demand growth and inventory with dealers could stay high. In order to survive the competitive intensity, Tata Motors said it will continue to rely on its SUV portfolio, with a planned launch of Tata Sierra in H2FY26. However, global trade uncertainties could results in continued volatility in FY26, it added. Read More: Tata Motors pins hope on new EVs, stronger demand to lead FY26 comeback The management added that its aftersales transformation initiatives have resulted in significant improvement, with a 21 percent improvement in same-day service metric, and a 25 percent drop in vehicles needing multiple workshop visits. The FY26 capex has been projected to be in-line with what the company spent during FY25. The management has assigned July 1, 2025 as the date for the demerger of CV business and amalgamation of TMPVL into Tata Motors. Between September and December this year, the car company is hoping for the final NCLT approval for the demerger, which will see the existing listed company to trade ex-CV business, and Tata Motors will be renamed as TMPVL, and the new CV company will be separately listed subsequently.

",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-shares-rise-nearly-3-as-trump-likely-to-announce-trade-deal-with-uk-13016848.html,"Shares of Tata Motors rose up to 3% on May 8 as the New York Times reported, citing three people familiar with the plans, that US President Donald Trump is expected to announce a trade deal between the United States and Britain. Trump posted on Truth Social earlier that he would hold an Oval Office news conference at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) on Thursday about a ""major trade deal with representatives of a big, and highly respected, country,"" using all capitalized letters. He did not offer more details but said it would be the ""first of many."" A UK official said on Tuesday that the two countries had made good progress on a trade deal that would likely include lower tariff quotas on steel and autos. Britain was not among the countries hit with additional tariffs, because it imports more from the U.S. than it exports there. At 9:37 am on May 8, shares of Tata Motors, the parent company of luxury car maker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), were trading 2.4% higher at Rs 697 apiece before hitting day's high of Rs 704.5. If the deal with the UK gets announced, it could be a major positive for Jaguar Land Rover, as nearly one-fifth of its revenue comes from the US market. The company had halted shipments of its vehicles in April owing to the US imposing 25% tariffs on all auto imports. However, recent reports have suggested that shipments have resumed but there has been no official confirmation. The Tata Motors stock rose on May 7 as well after the announcement of the India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA), signed on Tuesday evening. This agreement includes provisions for a significant reduction in import tariffs on premium cars destined for India. Tariffs, previously exceeding 100%, are set to drop to 10% under a quota system. Also, Tata Motors said on Tuesday its shareholders have approved the company's plan to split the automaker into two listed companies, separating its passenger and commercial vehicle arms. Tata Motors had said last March that it would divide its commercial vehicle arm from its passenger business, which houses its cash cow luxury Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) brand, to unlock better growth prospects. The proposal, which would give the shareholders equal stakes in both the listed entities, was approved with 99.9995% of votes, it said in an exchange filing.

News agency Reuters, quoting the London Times, reported that Tata Motor's luxury car brand JLR has sent its first batch of vehicles on April 30, after almost a month-long pause. JLR had stopped shipments in early April due to the 25% tariff on car imports put in place by that US President Trump on April 2. Tata Motors’ shares are higher by up to 1% on May 5, and higher by 12.5 percent over last one month. JLR has not officially commented on resuming the shipments, but the development is significant as US is the second-biggest market for UK-made JLR cars after the European Union, making up nearly 20 percent of its exports. Read More A JLR spokesperson told Reuters that the US remains a key market for its luxury cars, even with 25% auto tariffs still in effect. ""As we work to address the new US trading terms with our business partners, we are enacting our planned short-term actions, as we develop our mid- to long-term plans. We will give a further update at our full year results in May,"" the statement added. President Trump had eased tariffs on auto parts with credits and other relief measures, though carmakers still say these are not enough to calm worries. Aston Martin, another UK carmaker, said it’ll split the tariff costs with customers, sell off its US inventory, and limit new shipments to the US for now.

Tata motors,Tata Motors shares sink 5% as Jaguar Land Rover pauses shipments to US amid heavy auto tariffs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-shares-sink-9-as-jaguar-land-rover-pauses-shipments-to-us-amid-heavy-auto-tariffs-12986592.html,"Auto major Tata Motors Ltd.'s shares were the worst performers on the Nifty 50 index in trade on April 7, after the auto player announced its key subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) would pause shipments to the U.S. in April in the wake of President Trump’s tariffs. At close, shares of Tata Motors were quoting Rs 581.1 on the NSE, down 5.3 percent compared to the previous session's closing price. The UK-based auto player stated that exports to U.S. will be halted, as the firm assess strategies for figuring out the 25 percent tariff on imported cars. Given the tariffs, international brokerage CLSA cut its rating on Tata Motors shares on April 4 to 'outperform', down from 'high-conviction outperform' earlier. The target price on Tata Group player was cut to Rs 765 per share, down from Rs 930 apiece earlier. The downgrade comes amid concerns over 25 percent U.S. tariffs on all auto imports, which could lead to a 14 percent year-on-year drop in JLR volumes by FY26. Tata Motors is expected to see a significant hit from the tariffs, as subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has deep exposure to the American market. JLR sold over 4 lakh units globally in FY24, of which about 23 percent were sold in US alone. CLSA expects JLR’s EBIT margin to fall to 7 percent in FY26/27, down from 9 percent in FY25. While JLR’s FY26 EBITDA estimate has been cut by 15 percent, free cash flow is expected to remain positive. ""The US alone contributed over a fifth of JLR's total revenue last year, making it a crucial market. With limited options to maintain margins and meet prior guidance, JLR will likely resort to price hikes and cost efficiencies. However, these strategies won’t yield immediate results, and a near-term hit to both revenue and profitability is expected,"" said Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom. Tata Motors shares have been under pressure over the past year, eroding 40 percent in value. In comparison, the Nifty 50 index has gained around one percent during the same time period.

HDFC,"HDFC digital loan against mutual funds: How it works, interest rates, and key risks",https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/hdfc-digital-loan-against-mutual-funds-how-it-works-interest-rates-and-key-risks-11750836247069.html,"Investors can digitally borrow funds against mutual fund holdings, that too without redeeming them. The pledged units remain invested, permitting investors access to funds while maintaining market exposure. One such facility is provided by financial institutions such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank among others through their online platforms. These services allow borrowers quick access to credit by pledging eligible mutual fund units without redeeming them. A loan against mutual funds (LAMF) allows investors to pledge their fund units as collateral to get a credit line or overdraft. This also helps individual borrowers to meet short term financial needs and aspirations. That too without liquidating long term investments. Now, the loan amount depends on the type, value and investment time of mutual funds pledged. However, given the concept of LAMF definitely provides liquidity without disturbing long term investments, still borrowers must tread carefully. Highlighting the need for caution, Charu Pahuja, CFP, Group Director & COO at Wise Finserv, advises“Digital loans against mutual funds can be a smart short-term solution, but only when used with caution. The loan gets processed online with minimal paperwork, giving you the funds you need—while your mutual fund units continue to stay invested and potentially grow. Always assess repayment ability and risks involved.” HDFC Bank’s LAMF is one among the first entirely automated options available in the market. Aspirational investors can apply through theofficial website of HDFC Bank and its internet banking portal. To apply you can select eligible schemes, authorise pledging through OTP and receive funds in under three minutes. This facility also provides borrowers to pledge both equity and debt mutual funds.

HDFC,HDFC AMC shares fall as much as 5% after JPMorgan downgrades on few near-term triggers,https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/hdfc-amc-share-price-gets-a-downgrade-from-jpmorgan-on-limited-near-term-catalysts-19621612.htm,"HDFC AMC shares fall as much as 5% after JPMorgan downgrades on few near-term triggersBrokerage firm JPMorgan sees limited near-term catalysts following HDFC AMC's 33% rally over the past three months, compared to a 10% rise in the Nifty.By Meghna Sen June 16, 2025, 9:19:45 AM IST (Updated)2 Min ReadShares of HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd. opened with losses of as much as 5% on Monday, June 16, after global brokerage firm JPMorgan downgraded the stock to 'Neutral' from its earlier rating of 'Overweight'. JPMorgan has maintained its price target at ₹5,000, implying a potential upside of just 1% from the stock’s last closing level on Friday. The foreign brokerage said in its note that it sees limited near-term catalysts following the stock’s 33% rally over the past three months, compared to a 10% rise in the Nifty. The brokerage mentioned that while equity inflows have remained strong over the past few years, supported by benign inflation, consistent GDP growth, and accommodative monetary policy, they have started to slow year-to-date. However, Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) flows remain resilient, which JPMorgan sees as a medium-term driver of the stock’s investment case. These positive factors seem to be fairly reflected in the fiscal year 2026 and 2027 price-to-earnings ratios of 37 times and 33 times. Out of the 27 analysts that have coverage on HDFC Asset Management Company, 20 of them have continue to have a 'Buy' rating on the stock, six have a 'Hold' rating, while one has a 'Sell' rating. HDFC Asset Management Company share settled 1.44% lower on Friday at Rs 4,959. The stock has risen 19% so far in 2025.Continue ReadingNote To ReadersDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on CNBCTV18.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

HDFC,"HDFC Bank Shares Rise as HDB Financial Services’ ₹12,500 Crore IPO Opens for Subscription
",https://groww.in/blog/hdfc-bank-shares-rise-as-hdb-financial-services-12500-crore-ipo-opens-for-subscription,"HDFC Bank’s share price edged higher on June 25, 2025, climbing 0.4% to ₹1,968.80 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in early trade, as its subsidiary HDB Financial Services launched a blockbuster initial public offering (IPO) valued at ₹12,500 crore. The IPO, which will remain open until June 27, comprises a fresh issue of ₹2,500 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of ₹10,000 crore by HDFC Bank, the promoter and majority shareholder. As of 12:48 PM, the bank’s share price is trading at ₹1,977.00, gaining 0.82%. HDFC Bank currently holds a 94.36% stake in HDB Financial Services, a non-banking financial company (NBFC) with a diversified lending portfolio and a pan-India presence. The IPO price band is set between ₹700 and ₹740 per share, with an application size of 20 shares. At the upper end of the price band, HDB Financial is valued at ₹61,400 crore. Ahead of the IPO, HDB Financial Services mobilised ₹3,369 crore from a robust line-up of anchor investors, including leading domestic and global names such as ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund, Nippon India Mutual Fund, Life Insurance Corporation of India, BlackRock, Allianz Global Investors, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Canada, Prudential plc, Copthall Mauritius Investment, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, APG Asset Management, Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, Goldman Sachs, Baillie Gifford, Schroder, Fidelity Investments, Societe Generale, Tata Investment Corporation, and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. This strong anchor book underscores institutional confidence in HDB Financial’s business model and growth prospects, further buoying sentiment around HDFC Bank shares. HDB Financial Services reported a net profit of ₹2,176 crore for the financial year ending March 2025, up sharply from ₹1,359 crore a year earlier. The company maintains healthy asset quality, with gross non-performing assets (GNPA) at 2.49% and net NPA at 1.38%. Its business spans secured and unsecured personal loans, gold loans, and lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), supported by over 1,700 branches across 1,200 cities and a customer base exceeding 1.9 crore. The IPO proceeds from the fresh issue will be used to strengthen HDB Financial’s Tier-I capital base, supporting future business growth and lending activities. The OFS component will allow HDFC Bank to pare down its stake, aligning with regulatory norms and unlocking value for shareholders. Brokerage houses have largely endorsed the IPO, citing HDB Financial’s strong parentage, established brand, robust governance, and sound risk management practices. SBI Securities, Anand Rathi, and Centrum have issued ‘subscribe’ recommendations, highlighting the company’s well-diversified product portfolio, granular retail lending model, and access to low-cost funding backed by a AAA-rated credit profile. At the upper end of the price band, the IPO values HDB Financial at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 3.7x for FY25, which is considered reasonable compared to larger peers such as Bajaj Finance and Cholamandalam Investment and Finance. Deven Choksey Research notes that the IPO is attractively priced, with a trailing twelve-month P/B of 3.4x versus the peer average of 4.4x. The grey market premium (GMP) for the HDB Financial IPO stands at approximately ₹74 per share, suggesting a potential listing gain of around 10%. This positive sentiment has translated into early gains for HDFC Bank shares, as investors anticipate a successful listing and value unlocking for the parent company.

The opening of HDB Financial Services’ ₹12,500 crore IPO has provided a fresh impetus to HDFC Bank’s stock, reflecting investor optimism around the subsidiary’s growth prospects and the parent bank’s value creation. With strong institutional backing, robust fundamentals, and reasonable valuations, the IPO is poised to be one of the largest and most closely watched offerings of the year. The market will be keenly tracking the subscription trends and eventual listing performance, which could further influence the trajectory of HDFC Bank shares in the near term.

NBFCs have shown remarkable resilience and gained importance in the financial sector ecosystem, growing from less than Rs 2 trillion AUM at the turn of the century to Rs 48 trillion at the end of FY25. NBFCs AUM as of FY19 was approximately Rs 23 trillion which grew at a 6-year CAGR of 13.2% to Rs 48 trillion as of FY25. Rapid revival in the economy is expected to drive consumer demand on FY26, leading to healthy growth in NBFCs. The NBFC credit is expected to grow at 15-17% between FY 25 and FY 28, driven by growth across retail, MSME and corporate segments continuing to be the primary drivers. HDB Financial Services Limited being one of the leading and the fastest growing NBFC is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities within the sector and the company aims to diversify and expand addressable customer segments by widening and enhancing product offering and continue to expand pan-India omni-channel distribution network.

We recommend to subscribe to the issue as a good long term investment as the company aligns with the aggressive mindset of the parent and improvement in npa levels that have seen recent deterioration while the CAR levels post issue are adequate for the next 12-18 months.SMIFS 15:39 | June 25, 2025Stock market live updates today: Sensex, Nifty 50 end higher; IT & media stocks shine Sensex ended 700.40 pts or 0.85% higher at 82,755.51 and Nifty 50 settled at 25,244.75, up by 200.40 pts or 0.8%.15:37 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: Deven Choksey Research expects HDBFSL’s AUM and disbursements to grow We expect that its AUM and disbursement will witness higher growth compared to FY25, led by higher urban and rural consumer demand driven by government’s intervention in reducing income tax rates, RBI’s efficient inflation management and expected cuts in GST rates for the overall consumption basket. HDB’s initial issue is priced at 3.4x TTM P/B (considered equity raise for calculating TTM BV) compared to the peer average of 4.4x TTM P/B. We believe the issue is attractively priced considering its parentage, peer group ROA average and its growth potential. We assign a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to the initial issue of the HDB Financial Services.- Deven Choksey Research 15:28 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: Canara Bank Securities emphasised HDB’s strong brand, despite valuation concerns. Some key concerns follow Key risks, according to Canara Bank Securities, include a high cost-to-income ratio (42%) and 27% unsecured loan exposure, though mitigated by data-driven underwriting. Despite valuation concerns, HDB’s strong brand, stable financials, rural reach, and niche positioning offer long-term potential for medium-to-long-term investor 15:19 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: BP WEALTH RECOMMENDS SUBSCRIBING TO THE ISSUE HDBFSL has reported a steady topline CAGR of 14.6% between FY23 and FY25. On the return front, HBDFSL has reported ROA at 2.1% in FY25 (vs 2.7% in FY24), while ROE declined from 17.9% in FY24 to 14.6% in FY25. GNPA and NNPA both increased from 1.9% and 0.6% in FY24 to 2.3% and 1.0% in FY25, respectively, as a result of slippages and write-offs during the fiscal. Despite the relatively lower return ratios and profitability growth, we remain optimistic of the company’s longer -term growth trend supported by a strong brand parentage, diversified liability franchise supported by a strong credit rating of AAA and a pan-India presence. The issue is valued at a P/B ratio of 3.9x at the upper price band based on FY25 book value, which we believe to be fairly valued compared to its peers. Considering the above compelling factors, we recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to this issue from a long term perspective.- BP WEALTH 15:09 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Limited IPO Live: Subscribed 0.28 times HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.28 times as at 3.03 pm on June 25, 2025.

NIIs: 0.32 times Retail: 0.19 times Employee reserved: 1.19 times Shareholder portion: 0.39 times QIBs: NIL Total: 0.20 times (BSE data as at 1.27 pm) 13:30 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: Recommendation from Mehta Equities We believe HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO brings investors an opportunity to invest in one of India’s leading and fastest-growing diversified NBFCs, with a well-balanced loan portfolio across Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance. We think as it is backed by the brand strength and operational discipline of its promoter, HDFC Bank, HDB has demonstrated consistent growth, strong underwriting capabilities, and resilient asset quality— evidenced by its low GNPA and NNPA ratios. We also think with over 19 million customers, a granular loan book, and a robust phygital distribution network of 1,771 branches and 140,000+ retail touchpoints, the company is well positioned to capture underpenetrated credit demand, particularly among “new to credit” borrowers. By looking at the financials, the company has demonstrated a a revenue growth of 14.3% in FY2024 and 15% in FY2025, with net profit rising by 25.6% in FY2024, though witnessing a modest decline of 11.6% in FY2025, mainly on account of two- fold increase in provision. On valuation parse at the upper price band of ₹740/-, the issue is asking a market cap of ₹ 61,388 cr. Based on FY 2025 earnings and fully diluted post-IPO paid up capital, the company is asking for Price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.5x which seems fairly valued looking at its industry average ~3.5-4x. Given its strong parentage, proven execution across cycles, diversified loan mix, and digital-first approach, we believe HDB Financial Services is well positioned to benefit from India’s ongoing financial inclusion and expanding retail credit demand.Hence, looking at all attributes we recommend investors to “SUBSCRIBE” the HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO for long term perspective.Mehta Equities 12:46 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Limited IPO Live: Subscribed 0.17 times HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.17 times as at 12.42 pm on June 25, 2025.

HDB’s asset quality is superior to peers on the back of its strong ownership and management pedigree. Its loan growth has been in line with peers over last 3 years. However we note that owing to HDB’s prudent focus on quality of customers, it earns a lower spread vis-à-vis peers. Also HDB’s operational cost is elevated. Thus HDB has managed to deliver ROA in the range of between 2 to 3% over last 3 years with FY25 post IPO ROA of 2.0%. This is below the peer average of 3.2% and Bajaj Finance’s 5.0% witnessed in FY25. Although we believe that HDB should be valued at a substantial discount to Bajaj Finance, its superior parentage and asset quality performance lead us to believe that it is attractively valued from a long term perspective upon comparing with Chola which has ROA of 2.4% and is being valued at 5.5x FY25 compared to HDB’s 3.4x (post IPO). Also HDB’s valuation is in line with the peer average which provides us comfort. Therefore, we recommend SUBSCRIBE to the issue, with a Long-term POSITIVE outlookNirmal Bang12:37 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says the launch timing coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs Timing the Tide: Cyclical Sweet Spot or Regulatory Compulsion?The IPO’s June launch coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs – credit growth remains robust at 15%+, asset quality metrics have normalized post-pandemic, and risk appetite is returning to rural markets. However, beneath these favorable conditions lurk structural challenges: rising cost of funds (HDB’s NIMs compressed 30 bps in FY24), increasing competition from new-age fintechs, and the perennial volatility of unsecured lending (27% of HDB’s portfolio). HDFC Bank’s decision to monetize part of its 94% stake through a ₹10,000 crore OFS while retaining 74% ownership suggests cautious optimism – they’re taking money off the table but maintaining skin in the game. The fresh ₹2,500 crore capital infusion will strengthen HDB’s tier-1 capital adequacy (currently at 16.8%), providing ammunition to chase growth while maintaining healthy buffers. For investors, the key consideration isn’t whether HDB is a good company (its 2.26% GNPA and 23% CAGR loan book growth confirm it is), but whether it can translate its HDFC lineage and pan-India presence into superior returns in a maturing market. In many ways, HDB’s IPO represents the NBFC sector’s transition from its “wild west” days to a more regulated, institutional phase. Its performance post-listing will reveal much about public market appetite for steady, diversified lenders in an environment where specialists often steal the spotlight. The company’s fate won’t just belong to its shareholders, but will serve as a barometer for the entire NBFC sector’s next chapter.- Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says 12:18 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial IPO Live Today: Not dependent on HDFC Bank for operational purposes, says HDB Financial CEO IPO-bound non-banking finance company (NBFC) HDB Financial Services does not get or give any business leads to HDFC Bank or share any office space with the latter, and is not reliant on its parent for operational purposes, MD & CEO G Ramesh, told businessline in an interaction. “We originate our business ourselves, we don’t get any leads from any of our promoter companies. We underwrite our own business, and operate 1,771 branches of HDB Financial Services. They are our own branches and there is no shared space with HDFC Bank. And our technology stack is different than the bank, which makes our business independent,” he said.His comments come in the backdrop of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 2024 draft norms which state that only a single entity within a bank group can undertake a particular form of permissible business.

First, it underscores the RBI’s push to bring systemically important NBFCs (like HDB, classified in the “upper layer”) under greater market discipline through public listings. Second, it highlights how banks are reluctantly reducing stakes in lucrative NBFC subsidiaries ahead of anticipated ownership caps.Third, and most importantly, the offering serves as a referendum on whether generalist NBFCs can command premium valuations in a market that increasingly rewards niche lenders. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned.

Coming at a time when RBI is pushing large NBFCs toward listing (with a September 2025 deadline), this IPO represents both a regulatory compliance exercise and a strategic coming-of-age for HDFC Bank’s 17-year-old shadow lending arm. The timing is telling: with credit growth outpacing GDP expansion and NBFCs capturing 40% of new retail loans, HDB’s public listing offers a calibrated entry point into India’s formalisation of credit. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, saysStay tuned.

NBFCs have shown remarkable resilience and gained importance in the financial sector ecosystem, growing from less than Rs 2 trillion AUM at the turn of the century to Rs 48 trillion at the end of FY25. NBFCs AUM as of FY19 was approximately Rs 23 trillion which grew at a 6-year CAGR of 13.2% to Rs 48 trillion as of FY25. Rapid revival in the economy is expected to drive consumer demand on FY26, leading to healthy growth in NBFCs. The NBFC credit is expected to grow at 15-17% between FY 25 and FY 28, driven by growth across retail, MSME and corporate segments continuing to be the primary drivers. HDB Financial Services Limited being one of the leading and the fastest growing NBFC is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities within the sector and the company aims to diversify and expand addressable customer segments by widening and enhancing product offering and continue to expand pan-India omni-channel distribution network.

We recommend to subscribe to the issue as a good long term investment as the company aligns with the aggressive mindset of the parent and improvement in npa levels that have seen recent deterioration while the CAR levels post issue are adequate for the next 12-18 months.SMIFS 15:39 | June 25, 2025Stock market live updates today: Sensex, Nifty 50 end higher; IT & media stocks shine Sensex ended 700.40 pts or 0.85% higher at 82,755.51 and Nifty 50 settled at 25,244.75, up by 200.40 pts or 0.8%.15:37 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: Deven Choksey Research expects HDBFSL’s AUM and disbursements to grow We expect that its AUM and disbursement will witness higher growth compared to FY25, led by higher urban and rural consumer demand driven by government’s intervention in reducing income tax rates, RBI’s efficient inflation management and expected cuts in GST rates for the overall consumption basket. HDB’s initial issue is priced at 3.4x TTM P/B (considered equity raise for calculating TTM BV) compared to the peer average of 4.4x TTM P/B. We believe the issue is attractively priced considering its parentage, peer group ROA average and its growth potential. We assign a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to the initial issue of the HDB Financial Services.- Deven Choksey Research 15:28 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: Canara Bank Securities emphasised HDB’s strong brand, despite valuation concerns. Some key concerns follow Key risks, according to Canara Bank Securities, include a high cost-to-income ratio (42%) and 27% unsecured loan exposure, though mitigated by data-driven underwriting. Despite valuation concerns, HDB’s strong brand, stable financials, rural reach, and niche positioning offer long-term potential for medium-to-long-term investor 15:19 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: BP WEALTH RECOMMENDS SUBSCRIBING TO THE ISSUE HDBFSL has reported a steady topline CAGR of 14.6% between FY23 and FY25. On the return front, HBDFSL has reported ROA at 2.1% in FY25 (vs 2.7% in FY24), while ROE declined from 17.9% in FY24 to 14.6% in FY25. GNPA and NNPA both increased from 1.9% and 0.6% in FY24 to 2.3% and 1.0% in FY25, respectively, as a result of slippages and write-offs during the fiscal. Despite the relatively lower return ratios and profitability growth, we remain optimistic of the company’s longer -term growth trend supported by a strong brand parentage, diversified liability franchise supported by a strong credit rating of AAA and a pan-India presence. The issue is valued at a P/B ratio of 3.9x at the upper price band based on FY25 book value, which we believe to be fairly valued compared to its peers. Considering the above compelling factors, we recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to this issue from a long term perspective.- BP WEALTH 15:09 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Limited IPO Live: Subscribed 0.28 times HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.28 times as at 3.03 pm on June 25, 2025.

We think as it is backed by the brand strength and operational discipline of its promoter, HDFC Bank, HDB has demonstrated consistent growth, strong underwriting capabilities, and resilient asset quality— evidenced by its low GNPA and NNPA ratios. We also think with over 19 million customers, a granular loan book, and a robust phygital distribution network of 1,771 branches and 140,000+ retail touchpoints, the company is well positioned to capture underpenetrated credit demand, particularly among “new to credit” borrowers. By looking at the financials, the company has demonstrated a a revenue growth of 14.3% in FY2024 and 15% in FY2025, with net profit rising by 25.6% in FY2024, though witnessing a modest decline of 11.6% in FY2025, mainly on account of two- fold increase in provision. On valuation parse at the upper price band of ₹740/-, the issue is asking a market cap of ₹ 61,388 cr. Based on FY 2025 earnings and fully diluted post-IPO paid up capital, the company is asking for Price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.5x which seems fairly valued looking at its industry average ~3.5-4x. Given its strong parentage, proven execution across cycles, diversified loan mix, and digital-first approach, we believe HDB Financial Services is well positioned to benefit from India’s ongoing financial inclusion and expanding retail credit demand.Hence, looking at all attributes we recommend investors to “SUBSCRIBE” the HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO for long term perspective.Mehta Equities 12:46 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Limited IPO Live: Subscribed 0.17 times HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.17 times as at 12.42 pm on June 25, 2025.

HDB’s asset quality is superior to peers on the back of its strong ownership and management pedigree. Its loan growth has been in line with peers over last 3 years. However we note that owing to HDB’s prudent focus on quality of customers, it earns a lower spread vis-à-vis peers. Also HDB’s operational cost is elevated. Thus HDB has managed to deliver ROA in the range of between 2 to 3% over last 3 years with FY25 post IPO ROA of 2.0%. This is below the peer average of 3.2% and Bajaj Finance’s 5.0% witnessed in FY25. Although we believe that HDB should be valued at a substantial discount to Bajaj Finance, its superior parentage and asset quality performance lead us to believe that it is attractively valued from a long term perspective upon comparing with Chola which has ROA of 2.4% and is being valued at 5.5x FY25 compared to HDB’s 3.4x (post IPO). Also HDB’s valuation is in line with the peer average which provides us comfort. Therefore, we recommend SUBSCRIBE to the issue, with a Long-term POSITIVE outlookNirmal Bang12:37 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says the launch timing coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs Timing the Tide: Cyclical Sweet Spot or Regulatory Compulsion?The IPO’s June launch coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs – credit growth remains robust at 15%+, asset quality metrics have normalized post-pandemic, and risk appetite is returning to rural markets. However, beneath these favorable conditions lurk structural challenges: rising cost of funds (HDB’s NIMs compressed 30 bps in FY24), increasing competition from new-age fintechs, and the perennial volatility of unsecured lending (27% of HDB’s portfolio). HDFC Bank’s decision to monetize part of its 94% stake through a ₹10,000 crore OFS while retaining 74% ownership suggests cautious optimism – they’re taking money off the table but maintaining skin in the game. The fresh ₹2,500 crore capital infusion will strengthen HDB’s tier-1 capital adequacy (currently at 16.8%), providing ammunition to chase growth while maintaining healthy buffers. For investors, the key consideration isn’t whether HDB is a good company (its 2.26% GNPA and 23% CAGR loan book growth confirm it is), but whether it can translate its HDFC lineage and pan-India presence into superior returns in a maturing market. In many ways, HDB’s IPO represents the NBFC sector’s transition from its “wild west” days to a more regulated, institutional phase. Its performance post-listing will reveal much about public market appetite for steady, diversified lenders in an environment where specialists often steal the spotlight. The company’s fate won’t just belong to its shareholders, but will serve as a barometer for the entire NBFC sector’s next chapter.- Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says 12:18 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial IPO Live Today: Not dependent on HDFC Bank for operational purposes, says HDB Financial CEO IPO-bound non-banking finance company (NBFC) HDB Financial Services does not get or give any business leads to HDFC Bank or share any office space with the latter, and is not reliant on its parent for operational purposes, MD & CEO G Ramesh, told businessline in an interaction. “We originate our business ourselves, we don’t get any leads from any of our promoter companies. We underwrite our own business, and operate 1,771 branches of HDB Financial Services. They are our own branches and there is no shared space with HDFC Bank. And our technology stack is different than the bank, which makes our business independent,” he said.His comments come in the backdrop of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 2024 draft norms which state that only a single entity within a bank group can undertake a particular form of permissible business.

First, it underscores the RBI’s push to bring systemically important NBFCs (like HDB, classified in the “upper layer”) under greater market discipline through public listings. Second, it highlights how banks are reluctantly reducing stakes in lucrative NBFC subsidiaries ahead of anticipated ownership caps.Third, and most importantly, the offering serves as a referendum on whether generalist NBFCs can command premium valuations in a market that increasingly rewards niche lenders. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned.

Coming at a time when RBI is pushing large NBFCs toward listing (with a September 2025 deadline), this IPO represents both a regulatory compliance exercise and a strategic coming-of-age for HDFC Bank’s 17-year-old shadow lending arm. The timing is telling: with credit growth outpacing GDP expansion and NBFCs capturing 40% of new retail loans, HDB’s public listing offers a calibrated entry point into India’s formalisation of credit. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, saysStay tuned.

The company is categorized as an Upper layer NBFC (NBFC-UL) by RBI. Its lending products are offered through three business verticals which is Enterprise lending (39.3%), Asset lending (38%) and consumer finance (22.7%). The company’s loan book comprises 73% secured loans and 27% unsecured loans, with its customer base primarily consisting of salaried individuals, self-employed professionals, and business owners. GNPA stood at 2.3% and NNPA at 1% for FY25. At the higher price band, the issue is valued at a P/BV of 3.4x (based on post-issue BVPS), which is in line with the peer average, making the issue appear fully priced. While the company has delivered steady growth in interest income driven by the expansion of its gross loan book, profitability has been impacted by interest rate volatility, leading to a decline in PAT for FY25. Additionally, the NIM has been under pressure and remains lower compared to peers. The declining ROE and PCR further underscore operational concerns.

HDFC,HDFC Bank stock to be in focus after Mehta family's FIR against CEO over Lilavati Trust allegations,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/hdfc-bank-stock-to-be-in-focus-after-mehta-familys-fir-against-ceo-over-lilavati-trust-allegations-11749397469101.html,"HDFC Bank shares are set to be in focus of stock market investors on Monday, 9 June 2025, after the Mehta family filed an FIR (First Information Report) against the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sashidhar Jagdishan on Sunday. The institutional lender called the FIR action “malicious and baseless” and said that the senior officials are currently being targeted by ‘unscrupulous persons’ who aim to abuse the legal process of recovering long outstanding loans from a defaulter named Splendour Gems Ltd. “Having exhausted all legal avenues without success, these individuals have now resorted to launching personal attacks against HDFC Bank and its MD & CEO in a clear attempt to malign their reputation and intimidate HDFC Bank into halting its recovery actions,” said the bank in the official statement. This FIR comes despite the Debt Recovery Tribunal order from 2004, which granted HDFC Bank the ‘recovery certificate’ for the outstanding dues, which remain “substantially unpaid” by the defaulter. The Mehta family-owned Splendour Gems defaulted on its loans in 2001. Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust is also owned and controlled by the Mehta family, which was seeking the HDFC Bank CEO's suspension and legal prosecution over alleged involvement in financial fraud and fund corruption related to the trust. According to Mint's earlier report, the Lilavati Trust has also accused eight individuals, including former bank employees, of financial fraud and misappropriation of the trust's funds. The bank plans to pursue legal methods to recover public funds and will address the retaliatory actions taken by the Mehta family. HDFC Bank shares closed 1.42 per cent higher at ₹1,978.70 after Friday's stock market session, compared to ₹1,950.90 at the previous market close. The company disclosed the FIR filing on Sunday evening, 8 June 2025. The shares of the largest private bank in India have given stock market investors more than 100 per cent return on their investment in the last five years and 26.69 per cent gains in the last one-year period. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the shares have gained 10.95 per cent in 2025, and are trading 3.39 per cent higher in the last five trading sessions. HDFC shares hit their 52-week high levels at ₹1,996.30 on Friday, 6 June 2025, while the 52-week low level was at ₹1,546.85 on 6 June 2024, exactly one year ago. The institutional lender's market capitalisation (M-Cap) stands at over ₹15.15 lakh crore as of the market close on Friday, 6 June 2025. Disclaimer: This story is for educational purposes only.

The cost-to-income and cost-to-asset ratios are expected to decline to ~40% and 1.7%, respectively, by FY27. With strategic liability management, margin recovery, and disciplined asset quality, HDFC Bank is poised for steady growth,” MOFSL said. It projects RoA and RoE at 1.8% and 14.1% by FY27, with the bank trading at 2.2x FY26E ABV.

While volumes are yet to pick up, the price action remains strong, suggesting further upside. A move towards ₹1,500 appears likely in the short term. Meanwhile, HDFC Bank is hovering around its all-time high of ₹1,880, where some profit booking may occur,” said Jain.

ICICI,ICICI Bank's Q4 Profit Jumps by 18% YoY and Stock Hits 52-Week/All-Time High,https://groww.in/blog/icici-bank-q4-profit-18-percent-stock-all-time-high,"ICICI Bank's shares surged at the opening of the bourses, reaching a fresh 52-week high and an all-time high of ₹1,437 after the announcement of its robust Q4FY25 performance. The bank reported an 18% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its net profit, amounting to ₹ 12,630 crore or ₹ 12,629.58 crore, compared to ₹ 10,707.53 crore in the same quarter of the previous year. This strong performance led domestic brokerages to become bullish on the stock. The bank’s share price is currently trading at ₹1,414.70. The bank demonstrated strong growth on the lending front, with its domestic loan book expanding by 13.9% YoY to ₹ 13.11 lakh crore. The retail loan segment also showed significant growth, increasing by 8.9% annually and 2% sequentially, constituting 52.4% of the total loan portfolio as of March-end 2025. Furthermore, ICICI Bank's net interest income (NII) for the quarter rose by 11% YoY to ₹ 21,193 crore, up from ₹ 19,093 crore in Q4FY24. ICICI Bank's net interest margin (NIM) in Q4FY25 stood at 4.41%, showing an improvement from 4.25% in Q3FY25 and slightly exceeding the 4.40% recorded in Q4FY24. For the entire financial year FY25, the NIM came in at 4.32%. This 16 basis point NIM expansion in Q4FY25 was noteworthy given the ongoing rate-cut cycle. For the entire financial year FY25, ICICI Bank's profit after tax climbed by 15.5% YoY to ₹ 47,227 crore. Additionally, the bank announced a dividend of ₹11 per share. On Monday, April 21, ICICI Bank's shares surged 2.15% to a new 52-week high of ₹ 1,437. Earlier, on Thursday, the shares had closed 3.7% higher at ₹1,406.65 on the BSE. The lender’s shares have gained 10% on a year-to-date basis. Over a longer period, the stock offered a 29% return in the last three years and a substantial 320% return in five years. The share price continued its upward trend, rising 5% in April so far after a 12% gain in the last month and was up 9% in the past week and 29.48% in the past year. Analysts at Motilal Oswal highlighted that it is rare for a bank of ICICI Bank's size to surprise positively with its operating performance, especially amid a volatile macro environment and strong competition for deposits. They noted that the bank's continuous investment in technology has driven consistent productivity gains, helping to maintain cost ratios. Furthermore, the business mix has shifted towards a higher-yielding portfolio, with balanced growth across different segments. Nuvama also emphasized ICICI Bank's ability to deliver strong and above-expected earnings growth even in the current volatile macroeconomic conditions, suggesting an expansion in the stock’s premium compared to its peers. The stable secured asset quality and a contingency provisioning buffer of ₹13,100 crore provide additional comfort. The significant NIM expansion in Q4FY25, despite expectations of a modest increase, was particularly commended. This positive movement has led to significant increase in the share price of the Bank, currently the bank’s share price is trading at ₹1,414.70.

SBI,Stock to buy for long-term: SBI sees big upside in this small-cap stock priced below ₹100,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/stock-to-buy-for-long-term-sbi-sees-big-upside-in-small-cap-stock-hi-tech-pipes-priced-below-rs-100-11749181359354.html,"Domestic brokerage house SBI Securities has reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating on Hi-Tech Pipes, assigning a revised target price of ₹138—an upside potential of 43.4 percent from the current market price of ₹96.2. The brokerage said the company delivered a strong performance in the March 2025 quarter and remains well-placed for growth, backed by new capacity additions and a rising share of value-added products. During the March quarter, Hi-Tech Pipes posted consolidated revenue of ₹733.7 crore, EBITDA of ₹34.9 crore, and profit after tax (PAT) of ₹17.6 crore. SBI Securities said revenue and PAT grew by 7.7 percent and 55.8 percent year-on-year, respectively, while EBITDA declined slightly by 1.2 percent. Sales volumes rose 7.7 percent year-on-year to 2.14 lakh tonnes, driven by strong demand from the infrastructure and construction sectors. SBI Securities highlighted that the company’s Sikandrabad and Sanand Phase-2 units are in advanced stages of commissioning and are expected to commence operations in FY26. Trial production at both facilities is likely to begin shortly. Once operational, these units will increase Hi-Tech Pipes’ total manufacturing capacity to 1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), up from the current 0.75 MTPA. The brokerage further stated that for FY26 and FY27, it has assumed annual capacity additions of 0.6 MTPA each, which translates into a 23.9 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in volumes. SBI Securities expects EBITDA per tonne to improve from ₹3,297 in FY25 to ₹3,639 in FY26 and ₹3,852 in FY27, aided by the higher contribution from value-added products (VAPs). According to SBI Securities, Hi-Tech Pipes is transitioning its portfolio from generic steel pipes to more value-added offerings like solar torque tubes and color-coated roofing sheets. The contribution of VAPs is projected to rise from 36 percent in FY25 to 42 percent in FY26 on a blended basis, thereby enhancing the company’s overall margin profile. Additionally, SBI Securities pointed out that the company is lining up fresh capital expenditure for FY27, aiming to boost capacity by another 25–30 percent. This includes groundwork at the Sri City project in Chennai and continued development of the Sanand Phase-2 facility. The management’s long-term vision is to scale up to a capacity of 2 MTPA by FY29. At the current market price, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.1x and 12.5x on FY26 and FY27 EPS estimates of ₹5.3 and ₹7.6, respectively. SBI Securities values the stock at 18x FY27 earnings to arrive at the target price of ₹138. The smallcap stock lost over 14 percent in the last 1 year. In June so far, the stock has advanced almost 2 percent following a 5.6 percent jump in May. Before that, it was in the red for 8 straight months between September 2024 and April 2025. Currently it is over 64 percent away from its 52-week high of ₹210.75, hit in September 2024. Meanwhile, it is trading closer to its 52-week low of ₹81.53, hit last month. In conclusion, SBI Securities believes that Hi-Tech Pipes is well-positioned to benefit from robust demand in the structural steel tubes segment, rising VAP contribution, and ongoing capacity expansion. The brokerage maintained its bullish outlook, highlighting strong long-term growth visibility and an attractive valuation, offering investors a potential 44.2 percent return from current levels.

SBI,"SBI Q4 Results: Net profit drops 10% to ₹18,642.5 crore; 1,590% dividend, fundraising declared",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/sbi-q4-results-net-profit-drops-10-to-rs-18-642-5-crore-1-590-dividend-fundraising-declared-11746262418875.html,"SBI Q4 Results: State Bank of India (SBI) announced its January March quarter results for fiscal 2024-25 (Q4FY25) on Saturday, May 3, reporting a drop of 10 per cent in standalone net profit to ₹18,642.59 crore, compared to ₹20,698.35 crore in the corresponding period last year. The public sector bank (PSB)'s net interest income (NII) stood at ₹42,774 crore. India's largest state-run lender's operating profit for FY25 crossed ₹1 lakh crore and grew by 17.89 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to ₹1,10,579 crore while operating profit for Q4FY25 grew by 8.83 per cent YoY to ₹31,286 crore. The PSB declared a dividend of ₹15.90 per share (1,590 per cent) for FY25. The record date of the dividend is fixed on May 16 and the payment date is May 30, 2025. “The Central Board of the Bank, has declared a Dividend of ₹15.90 per equity share (1,590 per cent) for the financial year ended 31.03.2025. The record date for determining the eligibility of members entitled to receive dividend on equity shares is Friday, 16.05.2025 and dividend payment date is fixed as 30.05.2025,” said SBI in a regulatory filing to the stock exchanges. SBI also declared fundraising of upto ₹25,000 crore in FY26 via qualified institution placement (QIP) or follow on public offer (FPO). “…Raising of equity capital for an amount aggregating upto ₹25,000 crore (including share premium) in one or more tranches during FY 2025-26 through Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP)/ Follow- on Public Offer (FPO) or any other permitted mode or a combination thereof in such manner and on such terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate, in accordance with the applicable Acts/ Regulations/ Guidelines and subject to receipt of all requisite approvals,” said SBI in its exchange filing. The board of the state-run bank has said ealier that it will discuss the proposal for fresh capital either through a follow-on public share sale, rights issue or qualified institutional placement on May 3. The fund raise plan by SBI comes at a time when Bank Nifty is near its record high, driven by bullishness among investors due to the sector’s relative insulation from tariff-related turmoil. Total income increased to ₹1,43,876 crore in March quarter from ₹1,28,412 crore in the same period a year ago, SBI said in a regulatory filing. During the quarter, the bank earned an interest income of ₹1,19,666 crore as against ₹1,11,043 crore a year ago. The bank saw an improvement in asset quality, with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) declining to 1.82 per cent of the total advances in the fourth quarter from 2.24 per cent as at March-end 2024. Similarly, net NPAs eased to 0.47 per cent as against 0.57 per cent. On a consolidated basis, SBI's net profit in the quarter fell 8 per cent to ₹19,600 crore as against ₹21,384 crore in the same period a year ago. Total income, however, increased to ₹1,79,562 crore from ₹1,64,914 crore. The bank's net profit for FY25 stood at ₹70,901 crore, witnessing a growth of 16.08 per cent YoY. The gross non performing asset (NPA) ratio stood at 1.82 per cent and improved by 42 bps YoY. The net NPA ratio was at 0.47 per cent improved by 10 bps YoY. SBI also revised its credit growth downwards to 12-13% from 14-16% earlier. The bank’s loan book stood at ₹42.2 lakh crore at the end of March 2025. That said the management said that the bank has a corporate loan pipeline of ₹3 lakh crore. “I think the uncertainty on tariffs is going to impact the overall economic scenario and investment scenario. So, from that background, we believe that there will be some moderation in the credit growth phase,” said CS Setty, chairman, SBI SBI also warned of pressure on net interest margin going forward as RBI is expected to cut rates going forward. “We expect another 50 base point rate cuts and starting with 25 base point in the next meeting. This means there is definitely going to be some pressure on the margins. We are not able to put any number on the margin pressure, but pressure is definitely going to be there because some of the portfolio gets repriced immediately with the policy rate cut while the deposits will take some time and the lag is generally 12 to 18 months for the existing stock to get repriced while the incremental deposits will get immediately repriced as we cut the rates on the deposits,” said Setty.

SBI,"Jefferies shares ""buy"" call for SBI, sees 21% potential upside on healthy outlook",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jefferies-shares-buy-call-for-sbi-sees-21-potential-upside-on-healthy-outlook-13150297.html,"Global brokerage firm Jefferies issued a “buy” recommendation on State Bank of India (SBI), assigning a target price of Rs 960 per share, implying a potential upside of 22 percent. According to the firm’s analysts, although economic activity in the first quarter was relatively subdued, the outlook is expected to improve by the second and third quarters, aided by the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary relief measures and the impact of tax cuts. Jefferies projects a credit growth of 12 percent and deposit growth of 10 percent for the public sector lender, supported by adequate liquidity buffers. The bank is also expected to maintain a return on assets (RoA) of 1 percent despite facing near-term pressure on net interest margins (NIM) due to anticipated rate cuts. In the final quarter of Fiscal Year 2025, SBI reported a decline in net profit, although net interest income (NII) registered a modest increase. Specifically, net profit dropped 10 percent compared to the same period last year, while NII rose by 2.7 percent to Rs 42,775 crore. On the positive side, SBI’s asset quality showed sequential improvement. The gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio declined to 1.82 percent in the January–March quarter from 2.07 percent in the preceding quarter. The net NPA ratio also improved to 0.47 percent from 0.53 percent. Geojit Financial Services also turned more optimistic, upgrading SBI to a “buy” from “hold” with a revised target price of Rs 888 per share. The firm expects credit growth to remain strong and resilient, even in a softening interest rate environment, and sees the bank sustaining healthy return on equity and return on assets. Among the 42 brokerages tracking SBI, 34 maintain a “buy” rating, 7 suggest “hold,” and only 1 recommends “sell.” Despite the bullish stance from analysts, shares of SBI have declined by 1.5 percent over the past month, even as the benchmark Nifty 50 index rose by 0.4 percent in the same period.

SBI,"Bank Nifty falls for 7th time in 9 sessions; PNB, IndusInd, SBI decline up to 2%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bank-nifty-falls-for-7th-time-in-9-sessions-pnb-indusind-sbi-decline-up-to-2-13014163.html,"Banking shares came under selling pressure on Tuesday, dragging the Bank Nifty index lower for the seventh time in nine sessions since April 23, as investors turned cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve's key interest rate decision due on Wednesday. The Bank Nifty slipped over 600 points to move below the 55,000 mark at 54,271.40. 11 of the 12 constituents of the index settled in the red, reflecting broad-based weakness across both public and private sector lenders. Bank of Baroda was the top loser in the pack, settling 10.91 percent lower at Rs 221.95 per share on the NSE after the PSU lender reported 7 percent drop in net interest income (NII) and a rise in provisions. Canara Bank followed closely, closing 5.22 percent lower at Rs 92.09 apiece. Punjab National Bank fell as much as 4.93 percent to settle at Rs 94.50 on the NSE. IndusInd Bank dropped 2.64 percent, while Canara Bank declined 2.24 percent. Selling pressure also extended to heavyweight names like State Bank of India and Kotak Mahindra Bank, which declined between 0.60 percent and 2.08 percent. Analysts attributed the fall to weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and broader uncertainty in the market. Kotak Mahindra Bank on Saturday reported a 7.57 percent drop in consolidated net profit to Rs 4,933 crore for the March quarter of FY25, hit by rising stress in its microlending portfolio. Similarly, State Bank of India saw its net profit slip 8.34 percent year-on-year to Rs 19,600 crore for the January-March quarter, largely due to a decline in net interest margins. Though SBI reported a 2.69 per cent rise in core net interest income to Rs 42,775 crore, its net interest margin dropped by 32 basis points year-on-year to 3.15 per cent, despite loan growth of over 12 per cent. Private sector majors HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank also traded lower in Tuesday's trade. Investor sentiment was further weighed down by uncertainty around the JSW-Bhushan Steel deal and global cues. Market participants are awaiting cues from the US Fed's policy stance, which will be crucial in shaping near-term direction for equities, especially rate-sensitive sectors like banking. ""Globally, US markets ended slightly lower due to profit-booking after a nine-day rally. Concerns over US-China trade negotiations and the upcoming Federal Reserve decision are keeping investors on edge,"" said Vikas Jain, Head of Research at Reliance Securities.

SBI,"Now is the time to have confidence and lend across segments: SBI chairman
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/banking/now-is-the-time-to-have-confidence-and-lend-across-segments-sbi-chairman-article-12949356.html,"State Bank of India expects to maintain a credit growth of 14–16 percent in FY26, chairman Challa Sreenivasulu Setty has said, adding there are no asset quality concerns and now is the time to step up lending. Speaking exclusively to Moneycontrol, Setty said, “With a lot of measures, both in terms of budgetary and monetary policy, we assume and expect that the credit growth will continue at the same pace next financial year.” As estimated, SBI will end FY25 with a 14–16 percent loan growth, he said. Setty, however, expects the banking system’s growth to moderate to around 11–12 percent in FY26. “SBI may have two percentage points more (growth),” he added. The chairman is confident that the retail and corporate loan books of SBI will contribute adequately to this growth target for the next fiscal. “Retail loans have been growing faster than the corporate. I think we are one of the outliers where the corporate growth is also significant,” Setty, who took over as the chairman in August, said. Also read: SBI Chairman CS Setty says mission to change the bank is 'very close to heart' In the December quarter, SBI’s corporate book grew by 14.5 percent and the bank had good visibility on term and working capital loan books. Asked if it was time to be a little cautious, the SBI chairman dismissed the suggestion, saying banks are going through the most benign asset quality cycle. “This is the time to put some confidence in the system and start looking at lending to sectors across agriculture, SME, retail, corporate,” he said. Setty is confident that if SBI grows at a 12 percent annually compounded rate, it can produce another SBI organically in six years. “We are busy doing our own business internally and organically there is great potential for this organisation,” he said. Setty also told Moneycontrol that the upgraded version of SBI’s mobile banking YONO 2.0 will be launched by July, attributing the launch delay to several new features. SBI has devised a new underwriting mechanism, the business rule engine, which enables it to sanction a loan to a SME borrower within 15 – 30 minutes, Setty said. The borrower has to give consent to the bank to access their GST statement and furnish income tax returns and processing is done in minutes. The bank gave Rs 34,000 crore in loans to SMEs under this data-based mechanism, he said. Discover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Cities on TCS’s radar include Bengaluru, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Kochi, Coimbatore, and Visakhapatnam.In Bengaluru, TCS has made two major acquisitions—1.4–1.6 million sq ft from Sattva-Darshita for Rs 2,250 crore and 3.2 million sq ft from TRIL for Rs 1,625 crore. Together, these are expected to add 25,000 seats. Additionally, TCS leased 800,000 sq ft at 360 Degrees Business Park in Electronic City, further expanding its presence in India’s tech capital.In Kolkata, the company is developing 30 acres across its Sanchita Park and Bengal Silicon Valley Hub campuses, adding capacity for 16,500 seats—12,500 of which will be ready in 2025.TCS has also leased new office spaces in Coimbatore and Hyderabad, while in Visakhapatnam, the firm secured 21.6 acres on a 99-year lease from the government. In Kochi, it is acquiring 37 acres in the Kinfra Electronics Manufacturing Cluster for Rs 690 crore.Live EventsAccording to industry experts, TCS’s real estate moves point to a revival in the commercial office sector and confidence in India’s talent ecosystem. The firm’s investment in both metro and tier-2 cities suggests a long-term strategy to diversify and scale its delivery capabilities.Although TCS has not issued an official comment due to its silent period, its aggressive office expansion clearly signals preparation for future demand, return-to-office models, and hybrid workforce strategies.In April NASSCOM said that the Indian domestic tech market has maintained its growth momentum and has been growing faster than exports. ""This growth is being driven by several tech companies that are focused on building in India for India, undertaking contracts for digital transformation of Indian enterprises and remain bullish about upcoming opportunities in the market,"" the industry association added.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onIndia’s largest IT playertcs new officestcs new citiesTata Consultancy Services expansionnew IT campuses in IndiaTCS office locationsBengaluru office spaceTCS bengalurutata consultancy services(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services maintained a buy call on the stock with a target price of ₹3,482, implying a 15 per cent upside potential. Motilal believes M&M is well-placed to outperform across its core businesses, led by a healthy recovery in rural areas and new product launches across both the UVs and tractors segments. Motilal pointed out while M&M has ""outperformed its own targets of earnings growth and RoE of 18 per cent in each of FY24 and FY25, it remains committed to delivering 15-20 per cent EPS growth and 18 per cent RoE, ensuring sustained profitability and shareholder value."" ""Given the sustained demand momentum in UVs and tractors, we have raised our earnings estimates by 4 per cent and 6 per cent for FY26 and FY27E, respectively. We estimate M&M to post a CAGR of nearly 13 per cent, 13 per cent and 18 per cent in revenue, EBITDA and PAT, respectively, over FY25-27E,"" said Motilal Oswal. Brokerage firm ICICI Securities has upgraded the stock to a 'buy' from an 'add', and increased the target price to ₹3,500 from ₹3,200 earlier. ""We envisage M&M’s strong performance continuing, led by its robust UV portfolio and FES segment’s healthier outlook. We upgrade it to a buy, from an add, with a SoTP-based target price of ₹3,500 versus ₹3,200, implying 24 times FY27E core EPS. Change in the target price is led by an 8 per cent and 9 per cent increase in FY26E and FY27E EPS, respectively, to account for higher volume growth and better margin performance,"" ICICI Securities said. Kotak Institutional Equities also maintained a buy with a fair value of ₹3,500. Kotak expects M&M to continue to outperform industry growth across the tractor and automotive segments, including the domestic PV and CV segments, given successful newer launches and strong brand equity. Kotak expects M&M's tractor segment to continue its uptrend, driven by higher reservoir levels and expectations of a normal monsoon. ""M&M continues to execute well by maintaining a leadership position in all three segments, which makes us constructive on the name,"" said Kotak. While the stock looks poised for a healthy growth in the long term due to strong fundamentals, some technical experts suggest booking some profits at the current juncture. ""Mahindra & Mahindra has delivered an impressive nearly 30 per cent rally and is now approaching the ₹3,100 mark. A bearish shark pattern has emerged on the daily chart within the ₹3,100– ₹3,200 zone—an area that also aligns with previous swing highs,"" said Jigar S. Patel, Senior Manager of Equity Research at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. ""This confluence suggests a potential resistance zone. Traders may consider booking partial profits in the ₹3,150– ₹3,200 range and look for buying opportunities on a healthy pullback,"" Patel said.

ONGC,"ONGC, Oil India share prices rise up to 4% as Israel-Iran conflict flares up crude prices further",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/ongc-oil-india-share-prices-rise-up-to-4-as-israel-iran-conflict-flares-up-crude-prices-further-11749787133745.html,"Stock Market Today: ONGC and Oil India share prices gained up to 4% on Friday, June 13, amidst rising crude prices, led by the Israel-Iran conflict. ONGC share price was among the top gainers among the Nifty 50 stocks despite the stock market crash. Today, the Indian benchmark indices — the Sensex and Nifty 50 — tumbled over 1.5% each. These upstream oil producers stand among the beneficiaries of rising crude prices, as they help improve realisations for these oil producers. However, this rise in crude prices may not be favourable for many others. “The economic consequences of this Israeli strike can be profound if the attack and counterattack by Iran linger long. Israel has declared that the operation will last several days. Brent crude prices have flared up by around 12% to $78. It can rise further if Iran, in retaliation, closes the Strait of Hormuz, severely restricting oil supply,” said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. While sectors that use oil derivatives as inputs, like aviation, paints, adhesives and tyres, will be hit hard, oil producers like ONGC and Oil India will remain resilient, added Vijayakumar. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation or ONGC share price opened at ₹255.55 on the National Stock Exchange on Friday, more than 3% higher compared to the previous day's closing price of ₹247.88. ONGC share price gained further to the intraday high of ₹255.9. Oil India share price opened at ₹480 and further rose to intraday highs of ₹486, translating into gains of close to 4% for Oil India share price in intraday deals today.

ONGC,ONGC share price gains 10% in March: Jefferies sees over 45% upside in this PSU stock. Here's why,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/ongc-share-price-gains-10-in-march-jefferies-sees-over-45-upside-in-this-psu-stock-heres-why-11743159870565.html,"PSU stock Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has witnessed a sharp rally this month, surging 10%, amid a rebound in the Indian stock market after five months of back-to-back losses. In today's trade itself, ONGC share price surged as much as 5% amid reports that Saudi Aramco is in talks to invest in two planned refineries in India. According to a Reuters report, Aramco is in separate talks to invest in Bharat Petroleum Corp's planned refinery in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and a proposed ONGC refinery in western Gujarat state, the sources said. On a longer time frame of five years, ONGC has jumped 283%, turning into a multibagger stock. Global brokerage Jefferies sees further scope for growth in the oil PSU company's shares, projecting a 47% upside from today's (March 28) close of ₹254.80. The brokerage highlighted several key reasons behind its bullish stance on the stock, such as strong production growth, a rise in the profitability of gas portfolio and expansion in the renewables business. The PSU oil company is targeting 5-6% annual production growth over FY26-28 on the back of ramp-up in crude and gas production from the KG basin by mid-CY25, new development at Daman and DSF2. ONGC has contracted BP as a technical service provider. Over the 10-year period of the contract, BP expects to increase crude oil/gas recovery by 44%/90% over ONGC's assumed recovery estimates. ""This should result in ~5% annual increase in crude and ~8% annual increase in gas production from the field FY27 onwards if BP succeeds. This could take ONGC's production growth CAGR to 10%+ over FY27-30,"" said Jefferies. The company expects ~20% of gas production to be eligible for new well gas price (US$ 8.5/mmbtu) in FY26 rising to ~100% by 2030. Furthermore, Jefferies highlighted that ONGC's Ayana acquisition is in line with its strategy of mature asset acquisition with land, grid access and PPAs in place. The current focus is on acquiring solar assets, with the company targeting 14% Equity IRR in these projects. ""We build in 2%/9% CAGR in crude/gas production but Mumbai High production growth poses upside risk to our est. We project 14% EPS CAGR over FY25-27 on production growth and better pricing in gas. The stock is discounting US$ 55 crude, making R-R favorable. Maintain Buy with PT of ₹375,"" Jefferies said. Disclaimer: This story is for educational purposes only.

The shares of the company were hovering around Rs 244 apiece in the early trading hours. The oil major released its Q4 FY25 results in the post market hours of May 21. The company reported a net profit of Rs 8,856.33 crore for the quarter under review. This marked a drop of over 20 percent from the Rs 11,096.03 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. ONGC's revenue from operations slightly fell to Rs 1.7 lakh crore in Q4 FY25, as against Rs 1.72 lakh crore in the year-ago period. The company also reported a standalone crude oil production of 4.70 million metric tonne (mmt) while gas production in the period was 4.893 billion cubic metre (BCM). Along with the Q4 results, ONGC also announced a final dividend of Rs 1.25 per equity share for the financial year 2025. For the entire financial year 2025, the oil major declared a total of 9 discoveries (5 in onland and 4 in offshore) in its operated acreages. Out of these, 7 are prospect (4 onland and 3 offshore) and 2 (1 in onland and 1 in offshore) are new pool discoveries. The company invested around Rs 62,000 crore in capital expenditure in FY25, including Rs 18,365 crore in OPaL, Rs 4,600 crore in ONGC Green Ltd for acquisition of PTC Energy and Ayana Renewables. Despite the fall in net profit, CLSA remained bullish on the stock. The international brokerage maintained a 'High Conviction Outperform' call for the stock, with a target price of Rs 360 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 47.5 percent from the stock's current market price. CLSA noted that the reported profit after tax was significantly lower than forecast, largely due to a big drywell write-off recognized in Q4. It also highlighted that the company's standalone oil and gas production rose 5 percent and 4 percent respectively on the back of rising output from KG-98/2 field. CLSA further said that ONGC's gas price realization rose by 4 percent QoQ, helped by increasing share of new well gas in its output. Jefferies kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 375 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 54 percent from the stock's current market price. The international brokerage said that Q4 standalone EBITDA was marginally below its estimate, but production and realization were more or less in line. Profit after tax was 31 percent below its estimate, on account of higher exploratory well write offs. Jefferies also noted that daily crude and gas production has risen for the second successive quarter. Motilal Oswal Financial Services also maintained a 'Buy' rating on ONGC. The domestic brokerage noted that the oil major's crude oil and gas sales were higher than its estimates. ""Higher-than-estimated DDA, dry well write-offs, and survey costs, along with lower-than-estimated other income, led to a miss on PAT,"" it said.

ONGC,Gas stocks in focus as govt hikes APM gas prices by 4%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/gas-stocks-in-focus-as-govt-hikes-apm-gas-prices-by-4-12981042.html,"Shares of Indian gas companies, including Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Ltd., Oil India Ltd., GAIL, and city gas distributors like Indraprastha Gas Ltd. (IGL), Mahanagar Gas Ltd. (MGL), and Gujarat Gas Ltd., are in focus on Tuesday, April 1, after the government increased gas prices under the Administered Price Mechanism (APM) by 4 percent. As of 10:00 am, ONGC shares were trading at Rs 246 and GAIL shares were trading at Rs 182 apiece, both with subtle gains, while shares of IGL and MGL were trading at a decline of over a percent, at Rs 200 and Rs 1,372, respectively. This is the first hike in APM gas prices since April 2023 which allowed for a 4 percent increase from the third year of implementation. The revised APM gas price is set at $ 6.75 per mmBtu for the April to September period, up from $ 6.5 per mmBtu in the first quarter of the year. Brokerage firm Jefferies, in a recent note, highlighted that reforms in gas and crude pricing could support ONGC's Earnings Per Share (EPS) to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14 percent over FY 2025 to FY 2027. This projection is seen as a positive trigger for ONGC, given the expected revenue boost from the price hike. The development also brings attention to city gas distributors like IGL and MGL, which have been under pressure recently. As of last Friday, shares of IGL were still down 28 percent from their peak, while MGL was down 30 percent. The revised pricing may offer a breather to these stocks, as investors assess the potential impact on margins and profitability.

The shares were exchanged at the price of Rs 417 per share, which indicates a four percent discount from the previous session's close. At 12.30 pm, ITC shares were quoting Rs 420.7, lower by 3 percent on the NSE. ""The net proceeds from the block trade will also be utilised to extend the group's existing share buyback programme announced on 18 March 2024 (the ""Programme"") by an additional £200 million, taking the total amount to be repurchased in 2025 to £1.1 billion,"" said BAT, in a filing with the London Stock Exchange. Earlier, reports suggested that ITC's largest shareholder BAT will likely offload 2.3 percent of its stake in ITC to institutional investors via the block deal method, marking its second such sale, after selling a 3.5 percent stake through block deals for Rs 16,690 crore last year. Investment banks Citi and Goldman Sachs are working on the proposed transaction, noted industry sources. With the floor price of Rs 400 per share, the total size of the block deal will valued around $1.36 billion or Rs 11,600 crore.

There can be no certainty that any such transaction will proceed, nor can there be any certainty as to the terms of any potential transaction. A further announcement will be made if and when appropriate.” If completed, the proceeds will be used to progress to within the target 2-2.5x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA leverage corridor (adjusted for Canada) by the end of 2026 and to continue our sustainable buyback program by enabling an intended £200 million increase in the share buyback to a total of £1.1 billion in 2025.

In the agri-business, revenue was up 9.7 per cent YoY led by leaf tobacco & value added agri products. The value-added agri portfolio recorded strong growth driven by coffee exports, the company said. ITC said its paperboards, paper and packaging business faced challenges due to low-priced Chinese and Indonesian supplies, soft domestic demand conditions, unprecedented surge in domestic wood costs and subdued realisations. The segment posted a low single digit revenue growth of 3 per cent driven by strong growth in exports. Discover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

ITC Hotels share price was listed at ₹188 apiece on the BSE, a discount of 30.37% to the discovered price of ₹270 per share. On NSE, ITC Hotels shares were listed at ₹180 apiece, a discount of 30.77% to the discovered price of ₹260 per share. After the listing, ITC Hotels shares extended the decline and were locked at 5% lower circuit on the BSE at ₹178.60 apiece. ITC Hotels is a demerged entity of cigarettes-to-FMCG conglomerate ITC Ltd. ITC Hotels listing date was fixed for today, January 29. ITC Hotels shares will be removed from Nifty 50 and Sensex on T+3 day, which is listing, plus three business days. ITC Hotels demerger ratio was 1:10, meaning existing ITC shareholders received 1 ITC Hotels share for every 10 ITC shares. The parent ITC Ltd retained a 40.0% stake in the new entity, with the remaining 60.0% distributed to shareholders. Following the demerger and listing of ITC Hotels Ltd, ITC Ltd shareholders are not expected to experience a material increase in value, as ITC Ltd's price will be adjusted to account for the holding company discount, said DevenChoksey Research. DevenChoksey Research values ITC shares on a Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) basis and has revised its target price to ₹520 post the demerger of its hotel business. Previously, the hotel segment was valued at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 17.3x. Following the demerger, the brokerage firm has adjusted the target price by ₹12 per share, accounting for the 40.0% retained holding and a 20.0% holding company discount, resulting in a revision of the target price from ₹534 to ₹520. “The demerger of ITC Ltd's hotel business unlocks value by allowing ITC to focus on its high-margin, cash-generative core segments, while the standalone hotels entity gains flexibility to capitalize on industry growth and attract strategic investors. This move enhances resource allocation, supports distinct growth trajectories for both entities, and is expected to improve valuation multiples. Accordingly, we upgrade our rating on ITC Ltd to ‘Buy’ from ‘Accumulate’, it said. ITC Hotels is one of the largest hotel companies with 140 hotels and ~13,000 operating keys as of October 2024. The company targets to grow its portfolio to 200+ hotels and 18,000+ keys by 2030. Around 35% of the hotel portfolio is owned by ITC Hotels and the balance is managed (including franchise model). The ARR and RevPAR of its owned hotels has grown 20%/18% YoY respectively in FY24 with occupancy level of 69%. The return ratios are healthy with RoCE of ~20%. It has a net cash surplus with negligible debt on books, thus providing healthy growth opportunity going ahead.

ITC Hotels demerger ratio is 1:10, i.e. shareholders will get one share of ITC Hotels for every 10 ITC shares held.

ITC Hotels is India's second-largest hospitality entity, boasting 140 properties compared to peers such as Indian Hotels (232), EIH (23), and Lemon Tree (112). Based on proforma financials, ITC Hotels' valuation is pegged at ₹150 per share, applying a 25x EV/EBITDA multiple on FY26E.

ITC shares are trading at P/E multiples of 26x and 23x for FY26E and FY27E EPS, respectively. ITC Share Price Live: ITC’s cigarette business is expected to continue strong volume growth, supported by its dominant market position and pricing power. Additionally, the company is focused on improving margins in its non-cigarette FMCG segment, which should drive overall profitability in the near term. Post-demerger, ITC will focus on its core cigarette and FMCG businesses, benefiting from a more asset-light structure, improving capital efficiency and returns. This shift is expected to improve ITC’s return ratios substantially. ITC’s focus on improving profitability offers an attractive long-term upside, said Akriti Mehrotra, Research Analyst, StoxBox. ITC Share Price Live: Analysts at brokerage firm B&K Securities highlighted ITC Hotels’ strategic focus on an asset-light, managed-hotel model, which is expected to enhance Return on Capital Employed (RoCE). They have projected ITC Hotels' fair listing value at ₹145, based on a 25x EV/EBITDA multiple on FY26E EBITDA. However, potential supply pressures are anticipated due to British American Tobacco's (BAT) exit. With ITC stock currently trading at a P/E of 23.8x on FY27E EPS, B&K has maintained a Buy rating on ITC with an unchanged target price of ₹588, assigning a P/E of 29x on FY27E EPS of ₹20.4. ITC Share Price Live: Alongside the demerger announcement, ITC also disclosed acquisitions in the hospitality sector. Through its wholly-owned arm, Russell Credit, ITC acquired a 2.44 per cent stake in EIH (Oberoi Hotels) and a 0.53 per cent stake in HLV Ltd (The Leela). Following these acquisitions, ITC now holds 16.13 per cent of EIH and 8.11 per cent of HLV, further solidifying its presence in the luxury hotel industry.

ITC Share Price Live: Most awaited ITC demerger gets price discovery at ₹455.60 and ₹27 adjusted towards ITC Hotel based on previous closing during the Special Pre-Open Session. The discovery price of ITC Hotel was in line with our expectations. Now ITC shareholders get 1 share of ITC Hotels for every 10 held of ITC. As per the index demerger listing rules ITC Hotels will be part of index and will be excluded from indices 3 business days after its listing date (if there are no circuit breakers). We are expecting the listing to be on or before February 2025 and based on the peer valuation expectation in the luxury hotel space, we are expecting the listing to be anywhere in the range of ₹100-125 per shares on conservative basis, said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. ITC Hotels' demerger is expected to unlock substantial shareholder value and enable the newly formed company to focus on growth in the luxury hospitality sector. Post demerger we continue to remain optimistic on the stocks and the demerger entity (ITC HOTEL). Hence, we recommend investors to hold and enjoy the unlocking shareholders value, Tapse added. ITC Share Price Live: ITC Hotels is expected to meet the criteria for inclusion in the MSCI Global Small Cap Indexes, based on Nuvama estimates. As a result, ITC Ltd. will remain part of the Standard Index. However, following the listing of ITC Hotels, the hotel business will be moved to the Small Cap Index and will no longer be part of the Standard Index. MSCI intends to apply a Price Adjustment Factor (PAF) to the market price of ITC on January 06, 2025 to reflect the spin-off. The PAF formula will be as follows: [P(t-1)] / [P(t)]. Since ITC HOTELS is not expected to start trading on the ex-date, MSCI intends to temporarily add a detached security ITC (DET) to the MSCI Global Standard Indexes as of close of January 06, 2025 (effective January 07, 2025). The price of ITC (DET) will be calculated by taking the difference between the closing price of ITC on January 03 and January 06. MSCI intends to maintain ITC (DET) at this price until ITC HOTELS begins trading. When ITC HOTELS starts trading, MSCI intends to apply a PAF to the market price of ITC (DET) based on terms of spin-off. Thereafter, MSCI intends to delete ITC (DET) from the MSCI Global Standard Indexes as of the close of the first trading day of ITC HOTELS using the closing market price of ITC HOTELS. Simultaneously, MSCI intends to add ITC HOTELS to the MSCI Global Small Cap Indexes as of the close of its first trading day, Nuvama explained. ITC Share Price Live: As per the current methodology, ITC Hotels stock needs to have at least a six month trading history to even qualify for derivative inclusion. Hence, ITC Hotels inclusion in the Futures & Options (F&O) segment is unlikely. After fulfilling all the quantitative qualification criteria for the derivative inclusion, ITC Hotels shares will need SEBI approval, which is quite subjective, said brokerage firm Nuvama. ITC Share Price Live: Centrum Broking expects in FY27E, ITC hotel business revenues to reach at ₹45.7 billion with an EBITDA margin of ~35% led by strong growth in domestic demand for the hospitality sector. Overall, it has a positive outlook on ITC Hotels demerger and retains a ‘Buy’ call on ITC shares with a target price of ₹583 apiece. ITC Share Price Live: ITC Hotels is one of the largest hotel companies with 140 hotels and ~13,000 operating keys as of October 2024. The company targets to grow its portfolio to 200+ hotels and 18,000+ keys by 2030. Around 35% of the hotel portfolio is owned by ITC Hotels and the balance is managed (including franchise model). The ARR and RevPAR of its owned hotels has grown 20%/18% YoY respectively in FY24 with occupancy level of 69%. The return ratios are healthy with RoCE of ~20%. It has a net cash surplus with negligible debt on books. ITC Share Price Live: In the short term, there is a possibility that few shareholders (especially ETFs) may have to forcefully exit ITC Hotels Ltd and this can create pressure on the stock price. We believe, any short term pressure on the ITC Hotels stock price will be a good opportunity for retail/HNI shareholders to accumulate quality business in their long term portfolio. Meanwhile, post demerger, investors can also continue to hold shares of ITC Ltd for long term given its diversified FMCG portfolio and steady growth in its core businesses (Cigarette & FMCG). Also, the demerger of its asset heavy hotels business will result in improved return ratios and cash flows. We believe, post demerger, ITC Ltd’s medium term fair value to be ₹525-550, said SBI Securities. ITC Share Price Live: For ITC Ltd shareholders, post demerger and listing of the ITC Hotels Ltd, there will be no material value addition as the price of ITC Ltd will get adjusted taking into account the holding company discount as shown above. Post listing of the ITC Hotels Ltd, investors will get an opportunity to participate directly in the growth story of ITC’s hotel business. Looking at the robust key addition pipeline for ITC Hotels and strong industry tailwinds, we believe ITC Hotels Ltd has potential to outperform ITC Ltd over a medium to long term period, said SBI Securities. ITC Share Price Live: ITC share price adjusted ₹27 lower after trading ex-date for hotels demerger session. ITC share price is currently around ₹455 apiece on the NSE and it has made a strong base at ₹430, which is expected to remain sacrosanct. ITC shareholders are advised to remain invested and add more in ₹430 to ₹450 zone, maintaining a strict stop loss of ₹100 below, said Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager — Technical Research at Anand Rathi. According to him, fresh investors can also buy on dips in the ₹450 to ₹430 zone, maintaining a stop loss at ₹400. ITC stock may soon touch ₹480 and can touch ₹520 on breaking above ₹480 on a closing basis. ITC Share Price Live: ITC shares are now trading ex-demerger, which means the value of ITC shares are now ex-hotels business. At the end of a special trading session for the price discovery of ITC Hotels on stock exchanges BSE and NSE, the market has assigned ITC share price of ₹455.60. ITC Share Price Live: The special trading session on BSE and NSE to derive ITC Hotels share price has ended. ITC share price was adjusted by ₹26 or 5.4% at ₹455.60 on NSE and by ₹27 or 5.6% at ₹455 on BSE. ITC Share Price Live: The discovered price of ITC shares is at ₹455.60 apiece in special trading session on NSE after demerger of ITC Hotels. ITC Share Price Live: According to Nuvama, ITC share price is expected to be adjusted by ₹22-25 on January 6, reflecting its 40% stake in the hotel business and incorporating a 20% holding discount. Abhilash Pagaria of Nuvama anticipates that the initial market price for ITC Hotels shares could range between ₹150-175 per share. ITC Share Price Live: The average EV/EBITDA multiple of ITC Hotels’ industry peers, i.e. Indian Hotels and EIH Ltd, is 25.0x. Assuming that ITC Hotels will list at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 20.0x - 30.0x, the share price of ITC Hotels Ltd is expected to list in the range of ₹113 to ₹170 per share, according to the calculations done by SBI Securities. ITC Share Price Live: ITC Hotels will issue equity shares directly to the shareholders of ITC in a manner that about 60% stake is held directly by ITC shareholders proportionate to their shareholding in ITC and remaining about 40% stake to continue with ITC. Overall, existing ITC shareholders will hold 100% of ITC Hotels, i.e. about 60% directly and balance of about 40% through their shareholding in ITC. ITC Share Price Live:ITC Hotels will be 51st constituent in Nifty 50 and 31st constituent in Sensex and daily will be considered in weight calculations of Index. However as it is not traded live so its market-cap and price will remain constant until it lists. Post its listing for three trading days, live market-cap will be considered to calculate weight in all the indices, said brokerage firm Nuvama. ITC Share Price Live:ITC Hotels shares will be maintained in all the NSE and BSE indices at a constant price i.e., the discovered price during the special pre-open session on January 6. However, ITC Hotels stock will be dropped from all the NSE and BSE indices at the last traded price which is effective at the open of ITC Hotels listing date + 3 business days. If the stock hits circuit limits, the exclusion will be postponed by two trading days each time. For instance: if ITC Hotels lists on February 10, 2025 then stock will compulsorily be deleted on February 13, 2025. ITC Share Price Live: BSE and NSE are conducting a special pre-open session from 9.00 am to 9.45 am to discover ITC Hotels stock price. Normal trading in ITC shares will resume at 10.00 am onwards. ITC Hotels share price will be calculated based on the difference between the closing prices of ITC shares on January 3, 2025, and the open price of ITC discovered during the SPOS (special pre-open session) on January 6, 2025. ITC Hotels demerger record date is today, January 6, and ITC shares will trade ex-demerger today. The Indian stock exchanges, BSE and NSE, are holding a special trading session to derive the ITC Hotels share price.

ITC Ltd.,"ITC Q3 Results 2025 Highlights: Net profit falls 7% to ₹4,935 crore, interim dividend of ₹6.5 per share declared",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/itc-q3-results-2025-live-updates-itc-q3-earnings-profit-itc-cigarette-volumes-itc-share-price-itc-dividend-itc-hotels-11738812329479.html,"ITC Q3 Results 2025 Highlights: On Thursday, diversified conglomerate ITC Ltd announced a 7% year-on-year decline in its consolidated net profit for the quarter ending December 31, 2024, reaching ₹4,935 crore. This profit is attributed to the company's owners. In comparison, ITC had recorded a profit of ₹5,335 crore in the same period last year. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: The hotels segment delivered an impressive performance this quarter, generating ₹922 crore in revenue, marking a 15% year-on-year growth despite a strong base. Profit before tax reached ₹302 crore, reflecting a 43% increase from the previous year. Effective January 1, 2025, the hotels business was demerged into ITC Hotels. EBITDA margins improved by 450 basis points year-on-year, driven by higher RevPAR, operational efficiencies, and strategic cost management efforts. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: By segment, the cigarette business recorded an 8% increase in revenue, while profit before tax (PBT) grew by 4% year-on-year. The company continued implementing strategic portfolio adjustments and market initiatives, emphasizing competitive regions and tackling illicit trade to drive volume-led growth and strengthen its market position. A sharp rise in leaf tobacco costs was partially offset through an improved product mix, strategic pricing adjustments, and targeted cost management efforts. Additionally, trade marketing expenditures were restructured in the third quarter to enhance last-mile execution. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: The cigarette-to hotel conglomerate's EBITDA for the third quarter rose 3% YoY and ex-paper, the same increased 5% YoY. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: The company has set Wednesday, February 12th, as the Record Date for the purpose of determining entitlement of the Members for such Interim Dividend. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: The Board has also recommended an interim dividend of ₹6.5 per share for the financial year ended March 2025. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Revenue from operations of the FMCG major increased 8% YoY to ₹20,350 crore. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: FMCG major ITC posted 7 per cent fall in its consolidated net profit to ₹4,935 crore for the quarter ending on December 31, 2024. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: According to Axis Securities, important aspects to monitor include the demand trends in rural and urban areas, competitive landscape, raw material expenses, and the future prospects of the hotels and agriculture sectors. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: The FMCG segment is expected to grow 5% YoY, while the hotels business may see a 15% increase. Paper and agri segments are projected to expand by 2% and 5% YoY, respectively, says Axis Securities. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ""We expect 7% YoY sales growth in cigarette business and 5% YoY sales growth in FMCG business. We expect 6% YoY growth in cigarette EBIT with 70bp decline in margins due to rise in leaf tobacco prices. In the FMCG business, we expect 3% de-growth in EBIT with 60bp decline in margins as price hike lags RM inflation. The paper segment remained weak, while the agriculture segment and hotel business performed well during the quarter,"" the brokerage firm said. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: “We project an 8% year-over-year increase in both revenue and EBITDA. Cigarette volume is expected to rise by 3.5% compared to last year, although margins will be slightly squeezed due to rising raw material costs. Overall, we forecast net revenue and EBIT growth of 7.5% and 5.5% year-over-year, respectively.” ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Kotak Institutional Equities estimates ITC cigarette volume growth at ~3.5% YoY, translating into 7.5% growth in gross cigarette sales. It expects cigarette EBIT growth at 5% YoY, with 145 bps YoY decline in EBIT margin, due to some inflation in leaf tobacco and other inputs. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Emkay Global sees ITC as relatively better placed in its FMCG coverage, where its diversified businesses will help negate any sharp slowdown in its segment. Cigarettes business volume growth has been positive and is likely to get support from steady contraction in informal supplies. Other FMCG is likely to be stressed in the near-term amid inflationary and demand stress. Given high inclination toward foods and beverages, we see inflationary stress to hurt margin delivery. Agri remains an opportunistic business, where we remain positive on long term value-add opportunities. Paper remains an area of concern, as the business is still under pressure, Emkay Global said. Emkay Global cuts its earnings estimates by ~2% each over FY25-27E. It maintained an ‘Add’ rating given limited upside potential, on ITC shares and has an unchanged target price of ₹520 per share. In the last six months, ITC’s stock price has performed relatively better versus FMCG peers. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC Q3FY25 core net profit is estimated to fall 3% YoY to ₹4,942 crore, while revenue growth is seen at 8% YoY to ₹17,794 crore, according to Nuvama Equities. EBITDA may fall 4% YoY to ₹6,086 crore, whereas EBITDA margin is estimated to decline 235 bps YoY to 34.2%. Nuvama reckons adjusted PAT shall decrease 11% YoY due to higher other income and lower tax rate (17%) in the base. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC’s Agri sales are likely to grow 20% YoY due to higher tobacco sales, while profit shall expand 12%. Leaf tobacco has experienced 20% inflation YoY, which is beneficial for ITC along with liberalisation of government exports in other commodities. Paper business is estimated to see 2% YoY sales growth, but 22% YoY dip in profits due to lack of operating leverage and high competition from imports, according to Nuvama Equities’ estimates. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC Hotels business sales are likely to grow 16% YoY in Q3FY25, aided by strong wedding and ongoing holiday season with profits likely to surge 27%. ITC Hotels demerger effective date was January 1 2025. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC’s FMCG segment is estimated to report weak sales and profit numbers during the December quarter. The segment’s sales are expected to grow 3% YoY, but EBITDA margins are likely to decline due to sharp raw material inflation in palm oil, maida and negative pricing in notebooks. ITC has not undertaken short-term measures such as cutting A&P, Nuvama Equities said. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Brokerage firm Nuvama Institutional Equities expects ITC’s revenue and EBITDA to grow 8% and 1% YoY. It expects Cigarette volumes to grow 3.5% YoY and post a slight compression in margins due to raw material inflation. It anticipates net revenue and EBIT to grow 7.5% and 5.5% YoY. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC’s Q3FY25 net profit is expected to fall 0.9% YoY to ₹5,290 crore, while its revenue may rise 6.7% YoY to ₹19,220 crore. EBITDA growth is seen at 4.8% YoY at ₹6,820 crore, while EBITDA margin is expected to contract to 35.5%, according to estimates by Motilal Oswal. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC share price has remained subdued in the past one year without delivering any significant returns. It hit a 52-week high of ₹500.01 apiece on September 27, 2024, and touched a 52-week low of ₹377.74 apiece on March 12, 2024. ITC shares have fallen 3.5% year-to-date (YTD), and 3.7% in the past six months. ITC stock has gained over 8% in one year. However, in the past two years, ITC shares have rallied 22% and have given 100% returns in three years. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: MOFSL expects 6% YoY growth in cigarette EBIT with 70 bps decline in margins due to rise in leaf tobacco prices. In the FMCG business, it expects 3% de-growth in EBIT with 60 bps decline in margins as price hike lags raw material inflation. The paper segment remained weak, while the agriculture segment and hotel business performed well during the quarter. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Motilal Oswal expects ITC’s cigarette business to show stable volumes and pricing, with the portfolio continuing to grow, aided by improvements in product mix. It models ~4% volume growth in the business in Q3FY25. It expects 7% YoY sales growth in cigarette business and 5% YoY sales growth in FMCG business. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Axis Securities expects ITC to report 9% YoY revenue growth. This would be driven by Cigarette business growth 6% YoY with 3% volume growth. It estimates FMCG segment to grow at 5% YoY, Hotels business to see 15% YoY growth, and Papers and Agri segments are seen growing at 2% and 5% YoY, respectively.

ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC is expected to report a net profit of ₹5,150 crore in Q3FY25, registering a fall of 7.6% from ₹5,572 crore in the year-ago period. The company’s revenue in the December quarter is expected to rise 8.6% to ₹17,713 crore from ₹16,314 crore, YoY. EBITDA is estimated to grow 3.4% to ₹6,231 crore from ₹6,024 crore, while EBITDA margin may contract by 175 bps to 35.2% from 36.9%, YoY, according to estimates by Axis Securities. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC’s cigarettes and FMCG segments are estimated to show a decent growth, while growth in agri and paperboards is expected to remain subdued, analysts said. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Analysts expect the diversified cigarette-to-FMCG conglomerate ITC to report a high-single digit revenue growth and fall in net profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. PAT may fall due to a low effective tax rate in Q3FY24. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC share price traded lower ahead of the announcement of Q3 results today. ITC share price opened at ₹450.10 apiece on the BSE as against its previous close of Rs 448.25 per share. However, ITC stock price fell 1.04% to ₹443.55 apiece.

JSW Steel,"JSW Steel, Vedanta, Tata Steel and other metal stocks drop up to 2% as Trump doubles tariffs to 50%",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/jsw-steel-vedanta-tata-steel-and-other-metal-stocks-drop-up-to-2-as-trump-doubles-tariffs-on-imports-to-25-11748838266504.html,"Indian metal stocks started June on a sombre note, with the Nifty Metal index declining 1.6% in early trade on Monday, June 2. Fourteen out of fifteen constituents opened in the red, trading with cuts of up to 2%. Lloyds Metals & Energy, JSW Steel, Welspun Corp, Vedanta, Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India emerged as the top laggards. While it’s not just metal counters facing selling pressure on Dalal Street today, the red wave swept across the board as global trade tensions resurfaced, triggering risk-off sentiment among investors. US President Donald Trump last week intensified trade tensions, announcing he would double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and accusing China of violating a prior agreement to ease tariffs. Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump said the US would raise steel tariffs from 25% to 50% starting next week while highlighting the partnership between Japan’s Nippon Steel and US Steel. Later, taking to his Truth Social account, Trump wrote, “It is my great honor to raise the tariffs on steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%, effective Wednesday, June 4th. Our steel and aluminum industries are coming back like never before. This will be yet another BIG jolt of great news for our wonderful steel and aluminum workers. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” The announcement comes amid an ongoing legal battle over the legality of some of Trump’s tariff policies. An appeals court has allowed the case to proceed after the Court of International Trade ordered a halt to the taxes. Trump accused China of violating a tariff truce reached in early May—a claim Beijing rejected, countering with accusations of US wrongdoing. China, the world’s largest steel producer and exporter, has seen its steel exports to the US decline significantly since the 25% tariff was imposed in 2018. While India's exports of steel and aluminium to the US are limited, the drop in metal stocks occurred amid growing concerns that a potential rise in tariffs could impact global metal demand. A call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected later this week in a possible effort to ease trade tensions. On the economic front, Chinese factory activity data contracted at a slower pace in May than the month prior, also aiding the selling pressure in metal stocks today. As tariff headlines once again dominate global markets, Asian indices opened in the red on Monday, with the Nifty 50 and Sensex falling nearly 1% in early trade. Rising geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia also pushed investors toward safe-haven assets, leading to a sharp decline in equities. According to Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, the market structure currently supports a continuation of the ongoing consolidation phase. He noted that global headwinds—particularly renewed tariff concerns—are likely to restrain any breakout rally. However, strong domestic tailwinds may offer support at lower levels. He added that the recent announcement of 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium by President Trump signals ongoing uncertainty in the global trade environment, which may act as a significant headwind for markets. On the domestic front, however, factors such as better-than-expected Q4 GDP growth at 7.4%, improving trends in consumption and capital expenditure, low inflation, and the prospect of continued rate cuts present a solid foundation for sustained economic growth in FY26. The only near-term challenge, he pointed out, is weak earnings growth. If leading indicators begin to reflect a recovery, the market has a strong chance of breaking out of its current range and moving higher.

Tata Steel share price that opened at ₹151.20 on the BSE on Wednesday, slightly higher than the previous days closing price of ₹149.50, continued to rise further. The Tata Steel share price rose to intraday high of ₹157.15, which translated in gains of around 4.5% for the Tata Steel share price. SAIL or Steel Authority of India Ltd share price also after opening slightly higher at ₹116.85, compared to previous close of ₹116.05 , gained further. The SAIL share price gained up to ₹120.75 during the intraday trades and this meant rise of up to 4%.

Tata Steel share price led the gains for the Nifty Metal Index that also saw intraday highs of 9,085.05, which meant gains of 2.8% for the metals index. Nifty metals index while was rising led by contribution from steel stocks most other metal stocks including those of NALCO and Hindalco Industries Ltd, too gained up to more than 4% The rise in steel and other metal stocks while is attributed to positive developments on the US China Tariff talks , India also has taken a firm stand on the Tariffs imposed by the US on metal imports from India According to a PTI report, India has proposed to impose retaliatory taxes on the United States in response to President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, and it has submitted this plan to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The news reports suggest that the safeguards measures would have an impact on $7.6 billion worth of relevant product imports from India into the US, with $1.91 billion in duty revenue collected. India as per news reports argues that the US's actions are in violation of the 1994 General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) and the Agreement on Safeguards (AoS) and also that India reserves the right to suspend concessions or other obligations that are substantially equivalent to the adverse effects of the measure to India's trade Meanwhile as India and the US are still to resolve the abovesaid issue on tariff, the positive developments in China -US trade and tariff talks is encouraging. China is the largest producer and consumer of commodities and thereby influences the international prices of commodities. Hence resolution and positive developments on US -China tariff discussions is a big positive for Steel and metal producers in India too Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

Kotak Mahindra Bank,"Kotak Mahindra Bank shares dive 7% as Q2 earnings disappoint, analysts cut target price
",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/kotak-mahindra-bank-shares-dive-7-as-q2-earnings-disappoint-analysts-cut-target-price-11729487651969.html,"Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank, one of India's leading private sector banks, fell 7.2% to ₹1,735 apiece during intraday trading on Monday, October 21. This decline followed the release of the bank's September quarter numbers (Q2FY25), which missed Street estimates and prompted some brokerage firms to lower their target prices on the stock. Global brokerage firm Phillip Capital downgraded the rating on the stock from 'buy' to ‘neutral’ and reduced its target price from ₹2,010 to ₹1,940. It said the bank is experiencing stress in its unsecured portfolio, which it expects to continue for several more quarters. It believes Kotak Mahindra Bank will be most affected by margin declines during the interest rate reversal phase, forecasting muted earnings growth due to pressure on net interest margins (NIM) and elevated credit costs. Systematix Institutional Equities also revised its target price for the stock, lowering it from ₹2,090 to ₹2,010 while maintaining a 'buy' rating. It estimates credit costs in the credit card, microfinance institution (MFI), and other portfolios to be 4%, 5%, and 0.4% for FY26, and 4%, 3%, and 0.4% for FY27, respectively, leading to earnings cut of approximately 5% for FY25-27. It values the standalone bank at 2.3x (down from 2.4x) the September 2026 price-to-adjusted book value (P/ABV), expecting an average return on assets (RoA) and return on equity (RoE) of 2.1% and 13.2%, compared to earlier projections of 2.2% and 13.5%. Investec has maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock but has reduced its target price from ₹2,300 to ₹2,185. Meanwhile, Motilal Oswal continues to hold its ""neutral"" rating with a target price of ₹1,950. It noted that the bank is navigating the limitations imposed by regulators effectively, and the potential lifting of the ban would further enhance its operating performance. Goldman Sachs retains its positive outlook on the stock, maintaining a 'buy' rating for a target price of ₹2,286 apiece. The bank reported a lower-than-expected 5% increase in profit for the July-September period at ₹3,344 crore, affected by higher loan provisions and shrinking lending margins. Provisions and contingencies, which are funds allocated for potential bad loans, surged nearly 80% to ₹660 crore during the quarter. Net Interest Income (NII) met expectations at ₹7,020 crore, reflecting an 11.5% year-over-year increase. However, the Net Interest Margin (NIM) declined to 4.9%, down 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter, due to a reduced share of higher-yielding unsecured loans, the full-quarter impact of regulatory constraints, and increased slippages. Analysts noted that the RBI's sanctions on credit card issuance and new customer onboarding via digital channels have negatively impacted the growth of high-yielding unsecured assets. They expect the pressure on NIM to continue, driven by moderate growth in the unsecured segment and the effects of deposit re-pricing. On the asset quality front, the Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio increased to 1.49%, up 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter, while the Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA) ratio rose by 8 basis points to 0.43%. Slippages for the quarter came in at ₹1870 crore, reflecting a ratio of 1.92% compared to 1.44% in Q1. Restructured loans stood at 0.06%, amounting to ₹240 crore. Meanwhile, the bank entered into an agreement to acquire the personal loan book of Standard Chartered Bank ( ₹4100 crore) to further fortify its position in the retail credit market. The acquisition is likely to be completed in the next three months, subject to regulatory/other approvals.

However, its net interest income (NII) surged 14% YoY to Rs 4,902 crore.The bank’s PAT was reported at Rs 339 crore for Q3 FY25, compared to Rs 716 crore for the year-ago period.The bank's Net Interest Margin (NIM) for Q3 FY25 stood at 6.04%, down from 6.18% in Q2 FY25, primarily due to a decline in the microfinance segment and an increased focus on the wholesale banking business.Regarding asset quality, IDFC First Bank's gross NPA ratio was 1.94% as of December 31, 2024, improving from 2.04% a year earlier, while the net NPA ratio dropped to 0.52% in Q3 FY25, compared to 0.68% in Q3 FY24. The lender reported that gross slippages, or the loans classified as non-performing for the first time, in the microfinance segment jumped nearly 49% on-quarter to Rs 437 crore.After the bank’s Q3 results, here’s what brokerages say:Live EventsJefferies: Buy | Target price: Rs 73Profit for Q3 FY25 declined by 53%, falling short of estimates, as slower topline growth and higher credit costs weighed on performance. The Microfinance Institution (MFI) segment continues to pressure earnings, with challenges expected to persist for the next 2-3 quarters, particularly as certain state governments plan to implement stricter collection norms.Nuvama: Hold | Target price: Rs 60IDFC First Bank reported stronger-than-expected credit quality in Q3 FY25, with slippage up just 8% QoQ versus the estimated 15%, and non-MFI slippage remaining flat, outperforming peers. MFI slippage rose 49% QoQ, but the bank did not use the MFI contingency buffer during the quarter.While asset quality was a positive, PPOP missed expectations. Core PPOP declined 7% QoQ but grew 15% YoY, impacted by MFI reversals and an 8% QoQ rise in operating expenses. Credit costs and slippage remained elevated due to MFI stress, which may peak in Q4 FY25E.Centrum Broking: Reduce | Target price: Rs 61IDFC First Bank continues to perform well in advances and deposits, outpacing peers in attracting low-cost deposits. However, challenges remain with high operating expenses and elevated credit costs, expected to improve only by FY27. The bank's ambitious RoE target remains out of reach, with Q3 FY25 RoE at 3.6%, falling short of FY24 levels. Consequently, Centrum has slightly lowered FY25 estimates, with RoE expected to exceed the cost of equity only by FY27. Given the weaker macroeconomic outlook and delays in meeting return targets, the broking firm maintained a ‘reduce’ rating on the stock.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

IDFC First Bank,Another merger in focus! IDFC First Bank shares climb 2%; IDFC hits fresh one-year high. Analyst views,https://www.businesstoday.in/markets/company-stock/story/another-merger-in-focus-idfc-first-bank-shares-climb-2-idfc-hits-fresh-one-year-high-analyst-views-388361-2023-07-05,"Shares of IDFC First Bank rose on Wednesday after the private lender said its advances grew by 24.50 per cent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis and 6.70 per cent sequentially (quarter-on-quarter) in the June quarter 2023-24 (Q1 FY24). The stock today climbed 2.14 per cent to close at Rs 80.33. At today's closing price, the scrip is 4.96 per cent away from its 52-week high price of Rs 84.52, a level seen on June 19, 2023. Non-banking lender IDFC also gained today as the stock settled 2.79 per cent higher, at Rs 114.30, after touching a fresh 52-week high of Rs 116.85. Both the companies recently approved a ""long-pending"" merger aimed at simplifying their corporate structure and easing regulatory compliance. The announcement came on the heels of HDFC-HDFC Bank mega merger. As part of the deal, IDFC's shareholders would get 155 shares of IDFC First Bank for each set of 100 shares they currently own in the former. IDFC held a 39.93 per cent stake in the banking arm (IDFC First Bank) through IDFC Financial Holdings. ""This was a long-pending merger which was stuck due to the complex legal structure of IDFC and hence, took time to unwind,"" Asutosh Mishra, Analyst at Ashika Stock Broking, told news agency Reuters. Private lender IDFC First today said its loans and advances grew from Rs 1,37,663 crore, as of June 30, 2022, to Rs 1,71,420 crore, as of June 30, 2023, YoY growth of 24.50 per cent. The QoQ growth was 6.70 per cent. ""Customer deposits grew from Rs 1,02,868 crore, as of June 30 2022, to Rs 1,48,508 crore, as of June 30, 2023, YoY growth of 44.40 per cent. The QoQ growth was 8.60 per cent,"" IDFC First Bank stated. On technical setup, analysts remained mixed on the counter. Support level for IDFC First Bank could be seen at Rs 75. ""IDFC First Bank is trading close to its 52-week highs, and the broader structure of the stock looks strong. The stock has strong momentum in the short term as it finds buying emergence around its 21-DEMA. Hence, the stock remains strong and is likely to attract more buying once it takes out its one-year high of Rs 84.50, the probability of which is strong. As far as levels are concerned, the stock has resistance across its higher trading zone of 82-85 and is likely to find support in the 74-72 zone in the comparable period,"" Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst, Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One ""Since last 3 months, the counter has already given 58 per cent return. Though, it looks lucrative now due to its recent up move. But one needs to be cautious since it is trading near its historical high of the Rs 83-85 zone. Additionally, on a daily scale, there is a negative divergence on RSI daily, echoing towards some profit booking in the coming few sessions. As of now wait and watch no fresh longs are recommended,"" said Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Technical Research Analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. ""IDFC First Bank is slightly bearish on the daily charts with strong resistance at Rs 85. A daily close below support of Rs 75 could lead to target of 67 in the near term,"" said AR Ramachandran from Tips2trades. Meanwhile, Indian equity benchmarks settled almost flat today. The 30-share BSE Sensex pack fell 33 points or 0.05 per cent to settle at 65,446.04, while the broader NSE Nifty index added 10 points or 0.05 per cent to settle at a fresh closing peak of 19,399.

In the same period last year, the Auto major had declared a profit of ₹2,042 crore. Jefferies India Private Ltd post Q3 results said that Bajaj auto reported a Modest Growth but In-line Q3 earnings performance Bajaj's Q3 Earnings Before Interest, tax, Deprecation and Amortisation (Ebitda0 and net profit rose just 3-6% YoY, although were in line with Jefferies Estimates. Bajaj expects 6-8% growth for motorcycle industry, and sees a strong 20%+ growth in exports in the near term. Jefferies analysts remain positive on growth outlook for both domestic and export two wheelers and expect 12% volume and 14% Earnings per share annual growth (CAGR) for Bajaj over FY25-27 estimated. Jefferies has fine-tuned estimates and retain their Buy ratings, although they said prefer Eicher Motors and TVS Motor Company Ltd within the two wheelers space. Bajaj Auto reported a decent quarterly performance, which was largely anticipated by the market, given the decline in domestic twowheeler sales during the quarter and slugged production, said Sagar Shetty, Research Analyst, StoxBox. The buoyancy in the topline was supported by three wheelers volumes and increased export contribution; however, a weaker product mix was the main pressure point during the three-month period, said Shetty. An improved Average Selling Price , with a 6% YoY growth, was one of the key pillars that enabled the company to help maintain its operational margins as per Shetty. The benefits of premiumisation largely reflected its products like Speed 400 and Duke 200/250, clocking in the highest-ever retail sales, with the expansion of its touchpoints boding well for the company. The company also experienced a five-fold surge in its e3W volumes, with market share expanding to a new quarter high (3x YoY), supported by an extended network from 600 to over 850 touchpoints. Chetak maintained its robust momentum, with volumes growing by ~2.5x YoY and an exit market share of 25% (+1100 bps). The company had mentioned improvement in its margin structure in the previous quarter’s concall, which was expected to materialize post the launch of the upgraded Chetak in November, said Shetty. Follow-up on the commentary would be key to gauge the profitability of its Electric Vehicles portfolio. Moving forward, management's comments on the CNG portfolio pipeline, production expansion plans, and margin improvement guidance will be key areas to watch, said Shetty Disclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of individual analysts, experts, and brokerage firms, not Mint.

Strong motorcycle exports and forex gains helped offset weak domestic demand. The firm's revenue rose 6 percent to Rs 12,148 crore in Q4FY25 as compared to Rs 11,485 crore in Q4FY24, ""driven by double-digit revenue growth on premium motorcycles, electric scooters and commercial vehicles, and another solid volume-led exports performance"". Revenue missed double-digit growth due to the temporary suspension of KTM exports, it said. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The two-wheeler major also said that the motorcycle market is set to clock 5-7 percent growth in FY26, and the 125cc and EV segments remain crucial. The 125cc category, which now contributes over half of all industry volumes, is expected to grow at nearly twice the pace of the overall market. The management said the e-scooter segment is likely to grow between 20 to 25 percent in FY26. Bajaj’s own Chetak electric scooter ended FY25 on a high note, emerging as the top-selling EV in the March quarter, adding to the company’s confidence in the segment’s prospects. Should you buy, sell, or hold the Bajaj Auto stock? Bernstein has maintained an ‘Outperform’ rating on Bajaj Auto with a target price of Rs 11,000 per share, an upside potential of 24 percent from the last close. The brokerage highlighted the company’s ability to sustain margins irrespective of the operating environment. It noted that the management communicated a positive outlook, particularly for exports. Despite challenges like the suspension of KTM exports, Bajaj Auto delivered a respectable Q4 with stable margins, it added. CLSA also retained its ‘Outperform’ rating with a target of Rs 10,149 per share. The company gained 12 percent year-on-year market share in the electric two-wheeler segment, reaching 25 percent in Q4, driven by the launch of a more affordable model. CLSA is building in a 7 percent volume growth in domestic two-wheelers and 12 percent in exports for FY26. On the flipside, Jefferies has a ‘Hold’ rating on the stock with a target of Rs 8,000 per share, lower than the last closing price of Rs 8,874. While Jefferies remains positive on the company’s growth prospects in both domestic and export two-wheeler segments and appreciates its expanding EV portfolio, it flagged concerns over the decline in market share in domestic motorcycles and India’s two-wheeler exports. It expects a 13 percent EPS CAGR over FY25–28 but noted that the stock’s 26x FY26 P/E valuation is expensive. The Pune-headquartered company's share price closed at Rs 8,874, higher by 0.3 percent from the last close on the NSE. Bajaj Auto has risen 13 percent in the last three months.

US President Trump on May 25 announced that he has postponed the imposition of 50 percent tariffs on European Union imports until July 9, after a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ""We had a very nice call and I agreed to move it,"" Trump told reporters. The announcement came after Trump threatened to impose a 50 percent tariff on EU products starting June 1, 2025, accusing the block of systematically exploiting the United States through unfair trade practices. Trump had announced a 25 percent tariff on automobile imports into the US in April, and later signed an executive order for some tariff relief, blending tax credits and waivers covering up to 15 percent of the value of vehicles assembled domestically. The early onset of monsoon, which has hit multiple parts of South India has also added to the sentiment. The Centre expects above normal monsoon conditions to provide a significant boost to consumption and productivity in the upcoming financial year, reinforcing confidence in India’s growth momentum, senior government sources told Moneycontrol. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Bajaj Auto shares were the top gainers on the index, rising over 2 percent to close at Rs 3,075 apiece and Rs 8,950 apiece respectively. MRF and Tata Motors shares gained over 1.5 percent each, while Samvardhana Motherson and Hero MotoCorp shares jumped over 1 percent each. Eicher Motors and Bharat Forge ended the session in the green with marginal gains. Despite the uptrend in the market, Maruti Suzuki and TVS Motor shares closed in the red with marginal losses. Balkrishna Industries shares tumbled over 6 percent after the company reported a sharp 25 percent decline in standalone net profit for the March quarter and laid out an aggressive capex plan to diversify into competitive tyre segments.

Eicher Motors,"Eicher Motors posts Q4 beat amid strong volumes; should you buy, sell, or hold?
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/eicher-motors-posts-q4-beat-amid-strong-volumes-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13025963.html,"Royal Enfield-maker Eicher Motors Ltd. shares will be in focus in trade on Thursday, May 15, after the auto player reported higher-than-expected net profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2025. The auto player reported a net profit of Rs 1,362 crore for the fourth quarter of FY25, marking a rise of nearly 27 percent from the Rs 1,070 crore net profit reported in Q4 FY24. The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose 23 percent on-year to Rs 5,150 crore. Eicher Motors is confident of accelerating growth both in India and overseas, riding on product pipeline, premiumisation trends and sustained brand-building efforts. The company, which recently crossed the selling of one million motorcycles in a year — a tenfold jump from about 100,000 units a decade ago — is betting on the middleweight segment to fuel its expansion. It holds an 88 percent market share in this category in India and continues to double down on it with upcoming launches and refreshes lined up through the year. “Premiumisation is continuing,” the management said in a post-earnings call, adding that marketing investments and activations are helping grow the segment. The company expects domestic momentum to remain healthy, especially with signs of a revival in urban markets thanks to income tax cuts, while rural demand continues to be strong. Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of Eicher Motors? ""Eicher Motors maintains focus on absolute profitability growth. We expect Royal Enfield to continue outperforming peers, on strong product actions, with near-term margin pressure to be addressed once operating leverage kicks in,"" said Emkay Global, maintaining its target price of Rs 6,300, with a 'buy' rating. Royal Enfield’s domestic volumes increased 24 percent YoY in Q4FY25 (versus 3 percent growth for the motorcycle segment). Nuvama Institutional Equities expects industry-beating 10 percent CAGR over FY25–27. Meanwhile, exports are likely to grow at a 17 percent CAGR. ""In all, given increased focus on key models and launch of new products, we forecast a revenue CAGR of 13 percent over FY25–27E,"" said the brokerage after reissuing its 'buy' rating, with an update share price target of Rs 6,200, up from Rs 6,100 earlier. International brokerage HSBC maintained a 'hold' rating on Eicher Motors with a target price of Rs 5,300 per share. The brokerage noted that Royal Enfield is on track to achieve its highest-ever volumes in FY26, as a result of acceleration in volume growth. However, this came at the cost of operating margins. HSBC said that the current estimates and valuations already reflect the volume uptick, while any improvement in margins could act as an upside risk. Jefferies, on the other hand, has a 'buy' call with a target of Rs 6,500 per share. It highlighted that Q4 EBITDA was in line and profit after tax beat estimates. Jefferies noted a pickup in Royal Enfield volumes since September, with the company pushing to drive demand.

Analysts at CLSA shared a 'sell' rating on BHEL, with a target price of Rs 189 per share, implying a downside of 36 percent from current levels. They believe that a surprise 26 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in the company's Q4 profit was due to slow-moving orders. ""The company's backlog has grown by 44 percent YoY in Q4FY24 as thermal orders picked up but operationally, a flat execution led to another weak quarter. We believe that the future of company's thermal business looks bleak beyond FY30,"" the brokerage firm added. Morgan Stanley also shared a target below current market price, setting it at Rs 220 per share, which indicates a downside of 34 percent as Q4 earnings missed estimates. However, they maintained an 'equal-weight' rating on BHEL, seeing improving earnings visibility with strong orders and healthy project pipeline. BHEL's net profit fell 26 percent YoY to Rs 489 crore in Q4FY24, while revenue rose marginally by 0.4 percent YoY to Rs 8,260 crore. The company's EBITDA, also known as operational profit, dropped by 30.6 percent YoY to Rs 728 crore, whereas EBITDA margins squeezed by 400 basis points (bps) YoY to 8.8 percent. ALSO READ: BHEL Q4 net profit falls 25% to Rs 484 crore, declares dividend The PSU firm's board recommended a final dividend of Rs 0.25 per share for FY24. Going ahead, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities believe that focus on execution would be key for BHEL. ""Against 1.3x YoY order backlog, the revenue growth guidance is a modest 10-15 percent YoY. A potential miss in execution would impact working capital. Moreover, BHEL may end up sharing part of the pricing gains from orders with its vendors, limiting case for margin uptick hereon,"" they cautioned, sharing a 'sell' rating on the counter, with a target price of Rs 75 per share.

BHEL,"BHEL Q1 results: Net loss widens to Rs 211 crore, revenue rises 10%
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/bhel-q1-results-net-loss-widens-to-rs-211-crore-revenue-rises-10-12783251.html,"Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) on July 31 said that its net loss for the quarter ended 30 June, 2024 widened to Rs 211 crore from Rs 205 crore. The company's losses widened despite a rise in its topline and a rise in demand for power equipment due to India's rising electricity generation. The country's electricity demand hit record highs in the April-June quarter. India met a record maximum power demand of 250 GW on May 30, led by a combined impact of weather-related loads and growing industrial and residential power consumption in these areas. Revenue from operations increased 9.6 percent to Rs 5,845 crore in the June quarter from Rs 5,003 crore in the same quarter last fiscal. The company restated figures from the previous year to reflect adjusted expenses of Rs 2330 crore, which included deferred tax and provisions and write-offs, according to an exchange filing. BHEL's expenses, which have hurt its earnings in the past four quarters, increased 9 percent to Rs 5875 crore, driven by a 9.4 percent rise in the cost of materials and services. The company's management on May 21, 2024 had said that it had won a number of order in 2021-22 and 2022-23 without raw material pass-through variation clauses which has led to its operating margins contracting. As of April 1, BHEL had an outstanding orderbook of around Rs 1,31,600 crores. Out of the total orderbook power sector orders made up Rs. 92,559 crores, and out of these Rs 92,000 Crore Rs 52,000 crore orders are received 2023-24, the BHEL's management had said. Transformer makers in India have been struggling to increase production due to several issues such as global supply chain hiccups, copper volatility, and raw material shortages. Electrical steel and copper are two crucial raw materials in a power transformer. Bushings, transformer oil, and insulation are other materials used. According to a recent report by Wood Mackenzie, the lead time for procuring transformers has steadily risen over the past two years, ranging from 120 to 210 weeks globally. Transformer prices have risen 60 percent to 80 percent on average since January 2020, driven by higher copper prices, which have increased more than 40 percent over the same period. Transformer makers have in the past few months called for government intervention to ease import policies for key raw materials that are in shortage in India. Indian transformer industries are operating at only 60 percent to 70 percent of their capacity. Furthermore, according to transformer companies, meeting short circuit criteria, as outlined by the Central Electricity Authority of India’s (CEA) guidelines, presents a challenge due to the diverse range of ratings and voltage classes selected by developers to optimize the overall costs. They added that although CEA has expanded its guidelines to accommodate these requirements, many solar developers insist on strict compliance, reducing the pool of available suppliers and exacerbating demand and lead times. BHEL's revenue from its industrials business, which is its second-biggest segment, reported a 30 percent surge during the period. Shares of BHEL on July 31 were trading 0.20 percent to Rs 316.70 apiece on BSE. Discover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Godrej Consumer,"Godrej Consumer Products stock rises as JPMorgan keeps 'overweight', sees 23% upside
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/godrej-consumer-products-stock-rises-as-jpmorgan-keeps-overweight-sees-23-upside-12890519.html,"Shares of FMCG major Godrej Consumer Products Limited gained over a percent to Rs 1,128 in morning trade on December 16 after JPMorgan maintained its 'overweight' call on the stock and raised the target price, suggesting that the company's long-term growth levers are still intact. With a price target of Rs 1,365, the international brokerage forecasts an upside potential of 23 percent from the last closing price of Rs 1,111 on the National Stock Exchange. The Godrej Consumer stock has tanked 10 percent in the past week and 25 percent in three months. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The company’s CFO attributed 85–90 percent of the recent volume deceleration to cyclical factors, ruling out structural demand concerns, Jefferies said. Godrej Consumer expects its soaps segment to return to normative volume growth levels over the next two quarters. If seasonality trends remain normal in the upcoming fourth quarter, the company anticipates a quicker recovery in the first half of FY25. Following a sharp sell-off, JPMorgan finds the risk-reward balance more favourable and expects the company to outperform its peers in the coming months. Earlier this month, Godrej Consumer Products provided a subdued growth outlook for the October-December quarter, expecting sales to grow in the mid-single digits. The company noted that demand conditions in the economy have remained weak over the past few months. Adverse weather events, including a delayed winter in North India and a cyclone in the South, have weighed on the Home Insecticides segment, which contributes a third of its standalone business. Despite these challenges, the rest of the portfolio is performing well and is on track to deliver double-digit underlying volume growth. In Q2, the company reported a 13 percent rise in net profit at Rs 491 crore, higher than the Rs 433 crore reported in the same quarter the previous year. The company's revenue from operations rose 2 percent to Rs 3,666 crore in the second quarter.

It also has a presence in Indonesia, Africa, the United States (US) and the Middle East, among others. In Q3FY25, consolidated revenue increased 3.0% YoY to Rs. 3,768cr mainly owing to flat growth in underlying volume. Revenue from India increased 2.6% YoY to Rs. 2,262cr led by growth in the home care and personal care segments. The home care segment grew 4.0% YoY, driven by the strong performance of Goodknight Agarbatti, which gained significant market share in the incense sticks segment. However, lower demand for household insecticides and a slowdown in urban consumption affected premium formats. Personal care grew 2.0% YoY, despite personal wash volumes declining in the midto-high single digits, while hair colour volumes grew in the mid-single digits. EBITDA fell 16.4% YoY owing to a 7.3% YoY increase in employee benefit expenses, 6.1% YoY rise in selling, marketing and distribution expenses and 19.7% YoY growth in other expenses. Therefore, we upgrade our rating to BUY from HOLD on the stock with a rolled forward target price of Rs. 1,237 using a target multiple of 45x P/E on FY27E.

Godrej Consumer,"Godrej Consumer shares tank 9% after firm flags Q3 margin, volume growth warning",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/godrej-consumer-shares-tank-9-after-firm-flags-q3-margin-volume-growth-warning-12885694.html,"Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) shares plunged over 9 percent in opening trade on December 9, weighed down by the company's weak growth outlook for the October-December quarter. The company anticipates sales growth in mid-single digit for Q3 while stating that demand conditions in the economy have been 'subdued' for the past few months. The company also anticipates a 'temporary downward breach' in the margin this quarter, from the normative range. Further adding to the pressure, the company said that it expects its standalone business to report around flattish UVG (Underlying Volume Growth) for the quarter under review. ""The demand conditions in India have been subdued for the past few months which is evident in FMCG market growth,"" said GCPL. Despite this, the company has over the past six quarters 'consistently delivered an average organic UVG of ~7 percent,' it added. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action The delayed onset of winter in the North and a cyclone in South India have impacted the Home Insecticides segment, which accounts for a third of the standalone business. Despite this, the rest of the portfolio is demonstrating strong performance and is on track to achieve double-digit UVG. Meanwhile, a high base of the previous fiscal, when the company enjoyed the benefits of favourable commodity prices which lifted its margins, is also likely to affect its on-year growth numbers. Despite the warnings, brokerages remain cautiously optimistic of the headwinds of slowdown subsiding soon. JPMorgan expressed optimism over the strong growth indicators for the rest of GCPL's portfolio while citing that these headwinds were not structural. While Jefferies does believe that the earlier-than-usual quarterly sales updates may add to investor concerns of an industry slowdown, it still expressed confidence over the management's outlook of margin impact being a transitory issue. UBS Securities also sided with GCPL, banking on the rest of the company's portfolio, which is expected to see double-digit volume growth. Along those lines, JPMorgan retained its 'overweight' call on GCPL, while UBS Securities and Jefferies held on to their respective 'buy' ratings on the stock.

Godrej Consumer,"Godrej Consumer Products bullish on demand revival amid easing inflation, tax cuts
",https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/godrej-consumer-products-bullish-on-demand-revival-amid-easing-inflation-tax-cuts-11746621320751.html,"New Delhi: Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) is betting on easing food inflation, tax cuts, and upcoming pay commission hikes to revive consumer demand over the next 12 to 18 months, CEO Sudhir Sitapati said on Wednesday. Despite lingering headwinds in its core soaps business due to a surge in palm oil prices, the company expects demand to pick up as inflation stabilizes and the impact of government welfare schemes kicks in. For the March quarter, GCPL reported a 6% rise in consolidated volumes and a 6.2% increase in revenue to ₹3,597.95 crore. But the company's broader strategy hinges on a pivot to emerging categories like pet care, liquid detergents, and deodorants, where it sees higher growth potential even as its soaps segment remains under pressure. Read this | FMCG's mixed bag: Rural strength masks urban slump in latest quarter Sitapati expressed confidence in the outlook for FMCG demand, citing factors like reduced food inflation and the government's income tax cuts and welfare schemes. “We are bullish about consumer demand over the next 12 months for a variety of reasons. The El Nino effect basically took up food prices in India last year. Food price inflation has an immediate impact on FMCG consumption. Now that El Nino has reversed, food price inflation has come down in the January to March period,” he said. “We should see some kind of demand coming back,” he added. GCPL's performance in the March quarter reflects this cautious optimism. Its consolidated revenue from operations grew 6.2% to ₹3,597.95 crore, with a profit of ₹411.90 crore, compared to a ₹1,893.21 crore loss a year ago. For FY24, the company saw a 2% rise in revenue from operations, totaling ₹14,364.29 crore. However, the company acknowledged the persistent challenges posed by inflationary pressures, particularly the sharp rise in palm oil prices, which have affected its Ebitda margins. Sitapati referred to the inflationary spike as a ""short-term blip"" and defended the company's decision to limit price hikes, passing on only 15–16% of the palm oil price increase to consumers rather than shocking the market with higher prices. Looking ahead, GCPL is shifting focus toward high-growth, under-penetrated categories, even as the soaps business continues to feel the impact of rising input costs. The company sees significant growth opportunities in body wash, liquid detergents, deodorants, air fresheners, pet care, and sexual wellness. In 2023, GCPL acquired the fast-moving consumer goods business of Raymond Consumer Care Ltd (RCCL), adding brands like Park Avenue deodorants and KamaSutra sexual wellness products to its portfolio. In April 2024, the company launched its pet care brand, ‘Godrej Ninja,’ in Tamil Nadu, leveraging the group’s marketing and manufacturing strengths. Additionally, GCPL made a strong move in liquid detergents with the launch of Fab Liquid, priced at ₹99, which achieved an annualized revenue run rate of ₹250 crore within 12 months. The company is also introducing more affordable products in its deodorant range, including a ₹99 antiperspirant, Block, and a reduced-price KamaSutra deodorant. Another segment poised for growth is household insecticides. Read this | Q4 earnings watch: Consumption giants drive revenue but lag in profits GCPL’s brands, Goodknight and Hit, saw double-digit growth in the March quarter. The company is also expanding in the category with innovations like a patented molecule (RMF) in its electric and incense formats, aiming to disrupt the market for illegal incense sticks and drive product and consumer awareness. GCPL anticipates mid-to-high single-digit volume growth in FY26, with high-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit Ebitda growth for FY25. Also read | FMCG stocks are usually a good defensive bet. So why are they underperforming now? The company expects a recovery in profits once palm oil prices stabilize, which should help support margin expansion in the coming quarters. Sitapati remains optimistic that GCPL’s focus on the ""categories of tomorrow"" will help the company weather short-term challenges and position it for long-term success.

Godrej Consumer,"Godrej Consumer Products share price plunges 10% after weak mid-Q3 update; Should you buy the FMCG stock?
",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/godrej-consumer-products-share-price-plunges-over-9-after-weak-mid-q3-update-should-you-buy-the-fmcg-stock-11733717305563.html,"Godrej Consumer Products share price plunged 10% in early trade on Monday after the FMCG company reported weak mid-quarter business update, highlighting demand headwinds. Godrej Consumer Products shares declined as much as 10% to ₹1,112.05 apiece on the BSE. “The demand conditions in India have been subdued for the past few months which is evident in FMCG market growth. Despite the demand conditions, GCPL has over the past six quarters consistently delivered an average organic UVG of ~7% on the back of category development supported by innovations and media investments,” Godrej Consumer Products said in its mid-Q3 business update. The surge in palm oil and derivatives prices to the extent of a YoY increase of 20-30% has impacted the soaps category, which represents 1/3rd of Godrej Consumer Products’ standalone business revenue. To partly offset the cost increases, the company said it has taken price increases, reduced grammage of key packs and reduced various trade schemes. “Such pricing actions typically have minimal impact on category consumption but do result in reduced inventory across wholesale and household pantry. Historical patterns indicate a normalization in volume growth following price stabilization, which we anticipate occurring in the next few months,” the company said. Moreover, the company also highlighted that unsupportive weather conditions have impacted the growth in its Home Insecticides segment, which contributes to 1/3rd of its standalone business. “The rest of the portfolio is demonstrating robust performance and expected to deliver double digit UVG. However, given the significant contribution of Soaps and HI to the overall business mix, the Standalone business is expected to report around flattish UVG and around mid-single digit sales growth in this quarter,” Godrej Consumer Products said. The current inflationary environment has created pressure on the margins and the company anticipates a temporary downward breach of the normative margins this quarter. Godrej Consumer Products expects its Indonesia business to deliver continued superior performance with mid-single digit volume growth and high single digit sales growth. In line with its earlier guidance, the GAUM (Godrej Africa, USA, and Middle East) organic business is expected to see volume decline due to reduction in trade stocks and portfolio simplification. “The effects of these actions would be largely completed in Q3 FY 25. However, we continue to do well on our profitability journey, and this is likely to be the fourth consecutive quarter of healthy EBITDA margins for GAUM,” it said. These are exceptional situations in Standalone business that the management believes are transitionary and not structural. Hence the management remains focused on navigating these near-term challenges while maintaining strategic investments for long-term growth as these negative trends are likely to persist for a few months, the company added. Factoring headwinds in Soaps and Home Insecticides during the quarter, Antique Stock Broking has cut its earnings estimates by 6%/ 6%/ 6% for FY25/ FY26/ FY27. It believes this weakness is transitionary in nature and the company should be able to recover its performance. The brokerage firm expects Godrej Consumer Products to deliver sales/ earnings CAGR of 9%/ 15% over FY24–27E driven by strong performance in Home Insecticides in India (product innovation) and improving profitability in GAUM business (post restructuring). Antique Stock Broking maintained a ‘Buy’ recommendation on Godrej Consumer Products shares and cut the target price to ₹1,512 per share from ₹1,605 earlier. Global brokerage JPMorgan maintained an ‘Overweight’ rating on Godrej Consumer Products shares with a target price of ₹1,410 apiece. It believes the company’s business update shows higher than anticipated revenue / earnings risk which are likely to further weigh on the share price performance in the short term. It expects price hikes would keep revenue growth at mid single-digit levels. At 9:40 AM, Godrej Consumer Products shares were trading 9.20% lower at ₹1,121.95 apiece on the BSE.

Godrej Consumer,India's Godrej Consumer slumps 9% after flagging weak Q3 demand,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/indias-godrej-consumer-slumps-9-after-flagging-weak-q3-demand-11733726725342.html,"Shares of India's Godrej Consumer Products slumped 9% on Monday, set for their worst day since March 2020 and dragging down its peers in the fast moving consumer goods sector after the firm warned of stress on demand and profit margins in the third quarter. The stock fell to its lowest since Jan. 18, its biggest one-day percentage drop since the onset of the pandemic. The decline dragged down the consumer goods index by 2.2%. The benchmark Nifty 50 was down about 0.1% on the day. Including Monday's decline, the consumer index has shed about 14% so far this quarter and is set for its worst ever quarterly performance as Indian consumer companies continue to feel the pinch of still-high inflation and a consequent fall in demand. Godrej Consumer said on Friday that two-thirds of its India business is under demand and margin stress due to higher raw material costs and unfavourable weather. The company's update will ""likely add to investor concerns"" on the consumer industry as a whole, which has been facing a slowdown, Jefferies said in a note. To partly offset higher costs in palm oil, a key ingredient for Godrej's soap business that contributes one-third to its standalone revenue, the company undertook measures including price increases during the quarter. ""Such pricing actions typically have minimal impact on category consumption but do result in reduced inventory across wholesale and household pantry,"" Godrej said. The warning by Godrej will also impact peers, Jefferies said, adding that recent analyst meetings with Hindustan Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive India have not provided confidence about a recovery in consumption.

Dr. Reddy’s Labs,Indian drugmaker Dr Reddy's shares slide after Q3 profit miss,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/indian-drugmaker-dr-reddy-s-shares-slide-after-q3-profit-miss-11737699531283.html,"(Reuters) -Shares of Dr Reddy's Laboratories dropped 6% on Friday and were on track for their worst session in nearly nine months, after missing its third-quarter profit estimates on lower sales and pricing pressures in the key North American market. The generic drugmaker was the top loser on the Nifty Pharma index and the benchmark Nifty 50 index. The pharma index was down 1.1% and the Nifty was up 0.5%, as of 11:45 a.m. IST. [.BO] ""The drop in shares comes as market sees near-term concerns over the company's muted U.S. sales,"" said Sumit Gupta, analyst at Centrum Broking. Indian generic drugmakers are struggling with slower sales in the United States, delayed approvals for new drug applications and lower pricing amid stiff competition. Reddy's growth will remain tepid over the next two years due to its high dependence on its generic version of Revlimid, a popular cancer treatment drug by Bristol-Myers Squibb, said Kunal Lakhan, an analyst at CLSA said. On Thursday, the company flagged slower sales of the generic cancer drug, Lenalidomide, weighing on its North America business. The region contributes about 41% of Reddy's overall revenue. Analysts at Nuvama said in a note the drug's sales were ""nearing the cliff"" due to increased competition in the region. ""Investor attention is on how Dr. Reddy's offsets the gRevlimid impact on earnings,"" Nuvama analysts said. Nuvama cut its target price on stock to 1,533 rupees from 1,553 rupees earlier, it retained ""buy"" rating. Reddy's North America sales rose 1% on-year but dropped 9% sequentially in the quarter. The company's India sales, which boosted its overall revenue, reflected growth slowdown due to subdued sales in its gastro and cardio segments, Macquarie said in a note. At least four brokerages slashed price targets on the stock, while three cut their ratings, LSEG data showed.

Dr. Reddy’s Labs,Dr Reddy's share price jumps 4% on Nuvama's upgrade to buy; brokerage sees potential despite risks from Revlimid expiry,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/dr-reddys-share-price-jumps-4-on-nuvamas-upgrade-to-buy-brokerage-sees-potential-despite-risks-from-revlimid-expiry-11736313901637.html,"Dr Reddy's share price jumped almost 4% during Wednesday’s trading session after Nuvama Institutional Equities, a brokerage firm, raised its rating on the stock from ‘Reduce’ to ‘Buy,’ setting a target price of ₹1,553. The brokerage is optimistic about the pharmaceutical company's proactive strategies to lessen the effects of the patent expiration for its blockbuster drug Revlimid in 2026. The brokerage noted that the expiration of the Revlimid patent in 2026 presents a considerable risk to Dr Reddy's earnings growth, as the medication accounts for approximately 40% of its FY24 EBITDA. The company is addressing this issue, and we can see that management has outlined strategies to lessen the effects of the Revlimid loss. “Dr Reddy's has prepared itself rather well for the Revlimid expiry via several initiatives, which should help it fend off about 80% of the expiry fallout on EBITDA. We have now incorporated its key products in our current forecasts and are raising FY27E earnings by 15%. We value the stock at 24x FY27E EPS, yielding a TP of ₹1,553/share. A favourable risk-reward forces our hand to upgrade Dr Reddy to ‘BUY’ (from ‘REDUCE’),” said the brokerage. On Wednesday, Dr Reddy's share price opened at ₹1,370.90 apiece on the BSE, the stock touched an intraday high of ₹1,404.60 per share and an intraday low of ₹1,361.55 apiece. Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical and Derivative Analyst at Angel One, said that Dr Reddy's share prices witnessed a sharp move during the opening hour as, after a gap up, prices went on to test beyond 1,400 levels. However, prices have erased some of the morning gains but still maintain the positive tone. Considering the higher top, higher bottom structure, we maintain a positive bias, with 1,420-1,450 as immediate resistance and 1,340 as strong support. Dr Reddy’s reported a 9.35% decrease in its consolidated net profit, amounting to ₹1,341.5 crore for the quarter ending September 2024. The pharmaceutical giant had recorded a net profit of ₹1,480 crore during the same period last year, as stated in a regulatory filing from the Hyderabad-based company. Nevertheless, its revenue grew by 16.51% to ₹8,016.2 crore in the September quarter, compared to ₹6,880.2 crore in the previous year’s quarter.

Dr Reddy's Laboratories share price opened at ₹1247.95 on the BSE on Friday, more than 3% lower than the previous day's closing price of ₹1289.35. Dr Reddy's Laboratories share price thereafter declined more than 6% to intraday lows of ₹1203.60. On Thursday, January 23, Dr Reddy's Laboratories reported that its consolidated profit after tax (PAT) for the quarter ended December 2024 (Q3) increased by 2% year-over-year (YoY) to ₹1,413.3 crore. Last year's third quarter PAT was ₹1,378.9 crore. There was some despoilment with the US sales growth as North American Generics sales grew only 1% YoY to ₹33,834 crore (down 9% sequentially) even though India and emerging markets sales grew 12-14% YoY. Jefferies India reacting to Dr Reddy's December quarter results said the weakness in core profitability shows an uptick in 3Q. Jefferies said Dr Reddy's 3Q underlying revenue growth moderated to 7.5% YoY, primarily due to flat US sales YoY. “Underlying EBITDA margins were also impacted, due to incremental competition in top products and high Selling General and Administrative costs. Dr Reddy's remains in an investment phase, with most catalysts likely to unfold in FY27 or beyond,” said Jefferies while lowering FY25-27 earnings per share estimate by 3-6%. Jefferies maintained ‘Underperform’ ratings with a revised price target of ₹1,170 on DRL stock. Analysts at JM Financials said US business reported tepid sales due to lower sales of generic Revlimid sales used to treat multiple myeloma and price erosion. However, despite lower Revlimid sales, EBITDA margins remained healthy at 27.5% in Q3, as per analysts. During the earnings call, the company reiterated its confidence in overcoming the generic Revlimid slump post-FY26 led by the Semaglutide opportunity in Canada & rest of the world as well as Abatacept from Jan'27. Margins are likely to be maintained at ~25% with flexibility on SG&A as well as R&D spending, according to JM Financial's estimates. JM Financial analysts believe the street is underappreciating the near-term Semaglutide opportunity in Canada as well as 18 other markets which are opening up from CY26. JM Financial post-Q3 maintained its estimates and BUY rating with a target price of ₹1,723.

The pharma firm reported 22 percent year-on-year increase in net profit, to reach Rs 1,594 crore. Its revenue for the quarter rose 8.6% YoY to Rs 8,506 crore. This positive momentum was attributed to growth in new product launches, the NRT acquisition, and improved segment-wise performance. Further, CEO Erez Israeli projected double-digit growth for FY26 along with his wish to resume manufacturing in the US while effectively navigating tariff risks.

The rally followed the company’s announcement of a strategic collaboration with Alvotech to co-develop, manufacture, and commercialize a biosimilar version of Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for global markets. Keytruda, a blockbuster immunotherapy drug used in the treatment of various cancers, generated global sales of $29.5 billion in 2024. The collaboration brings together the biosimilar expertise of both companies and is expected to accelerate development timelines while broadening the global reach of the product. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s and Alvotech will jointly handle development, manufacturing, and commercialisation, with shared responsibilities and costs. Barring certain exceptions, both companies will also have the right to market the biosimilar in international markets. Adding to the stock’s momentum, HSBC upgraded Dr. Reddy’s to a ‘Buy’ from ‘Hold’, and raised its target price to Rs 1,445, up from Rs 1,235. In its note, HSBC said Semaglutide—a drug used for type-2 diabetes—is expected to significantly boost the company’s Earnings Per Share (EPS) within a year of its launch in key regions. The brokerage sees Canada, Brazil, and India as key target markets for Semaglutide, where demand remains strong but supply is currently constrained. Unlike typical generics, HSBC does not expect prices for Semaglutide to fall sharply due to sustained demand. It estimates that the Semaglutide opportunity could nearly triple in these markets over the next two to four years. In the past month, Dr. Reddy’s stock has gained 9 percent, significantly outperforming the 1 percent rise in the benchmark Nifty 50.

""Wherever (price increase) is absolutely essential, we will have to take some pricing action,"" Nestle India Managing Director Suresh Narayanan told Reuters in Mumbai on February 24, adding the price hike will be ‘as low as possible’.

The measures announced in the Union Budget to reduce personal income tax rates is expected to boost consumption, with its effects likely to be seen from the second half of the year.

For the quarter gone by, margins are likely to be under stress from high coffee and cocoa prices. Weak operational performance is also expected to drag the company's net profit. According to a Moneycontrol poll of 11 brokerages, Nestle India is likely to report a 4.4 percent year-on-year rise in revenue at Rs 5,500 crore compared to Rs 5,268 crore reported in the same quarter last year. Net profit for the January to March period is likely to fall nearly six percent to Rs 870 crore as against Rs 924 reported in the March quarter of the previous financial year. Earnings estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a diverse range. While even the most optimistic estimate sees Nestle India’s net profit tumbling by half a percent, the most pessimistic suggests the net profit could crack 9.5 percent on-year. According to experts, increased competitive intensity in infant nutrition and downtrading in the coffee business to weigh on the revenue growth for the quarter. Volume Growth: Experts are pencilling in low single digit volume growth, between two and three percent, as lower urban demand continues to impact Nestle India's topline growth. However, analysts at Kotak say the volume growth will be partly buoyed by some benefit in Maggi portfolio due to Maha Kumbh 2025. Margins: EBITDA margin is likely to be under stress due to inflation in coffee, cocoa, wheat and vegetable oil, on a high base. However, the firm has undertaken some hikes in chocolates, coffee, and Maggi, which should lend some support. Demand weak: Overall demand trends, have improved sequentially given marginal recovery in urban - however slowdown still persists. ""As the urban slowdown tapers down (likely by Q2FY26) we estimate a demand trends to further improve from here on,"" said analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities. Nestle India is seeing more of an impact from the lag in urban demand as a result of its urban-skewed portfolio mix. Sharp fall in PAT: Kotak explained the sharp decline in net profit could be as a result of lower other income. Nestle India's cash balance is likely to be lower, following its investment of Rs 700 crore in a joint venture with pharma giant Dr Reddy's. Analysts will closely monitor the management’s commentaries on demand and material costs. They will also pay attention to raw material prices and their effect on EBITDA margins, as well as the growing competitive pressure across segments.
