Experience from previous projects and current operations are also considered. We continually monitor our construction sites where infrastructure is being established.

Give details in 100 words / web link Infosys has a highly resilient Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) called Phoenix which is certified ISO 22301:2019 Security and Resilience — Business Continuity Management Standard. This program ensures seamless continuity of business and utmost safety of employees and organization assets, while continuously meeting client expectations and helping Infosys to be seen as a leader. The BCMS program provides a robust framework for planning, establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and continually improving business continuity measures across Infosys and its subsidiaries as per the global BCMS strategy. Comprehensive business continuity plans are created at three levels covering the business functions, locations and accounts. Integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the BCMS plans guide our typical response to events, such as catastrophes, natural or human-made disasters, which could disrupt or severely constrain our operations. This covers various crisis scenarios as part of detailed risk assessments for functions, locations and accounts which are documented with mitigation plans along with controls put in place. This has ensured a highly resilient management system that has been continuously validated through tests and exercises, and various incidents, which have been successfully tackled without any major business continuity or employee safety impacts. The best example of this has been the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic in the last two years. An efficient business continuity management policy has enabled us to maintain the status quo during disasters and pandemics as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible. It has also helped to minimize downtime and achieve sustainable improvements in business continuity and regulatory compliance.

Our responsibility was to provide independent assurance on the Report content as described in the scope, boundary, and limitations. Reporting Criteria The Company applies non-financial performance criteria for developing its report derived from the following: • The International Integrated Reporting Council’s <IR> Framework. • Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2021. • SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) Standard for Software & IT Services. • Principles of National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct as part of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR). Assurance Standards Used We conducted our assurance in accordance with the following assurance standards • Assurance requirements of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) International Standard on – Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information- (ISAE 3000- revised), for the select environmental and social disclosures in the Report. – Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (ISAE 3410), for the GHG emissions data. • Under these standards, we have reviewed the information presented in the Report against the characteristics of relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability. • Limited assurance consists primarily of enquiries and analytical procedures. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. • Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but it is not a guarantee that it will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. • A reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 (revised) and ISAE 3410 involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the quantification of emissions and related information in ‘the Report’.

Health and safety management system: 10a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes / No). If yes, the coverage of such system? Yes. Infosys recognizes and accords highest priority to safety and well-being of its employees and other relevant parties. Our HSE Policy enunciates our philosophy and commitment towards the management of key Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) aspects. In line with our strategy, our Health, Safety and Environmental Management System (HSEMS) at all India locations is certified to ISO 45001:2018 standard. HSEMS is implemented at all our overseas locations based on legal requirements / internal benchmarks and have also included them in the internal audits cycle. We have established numerous interventions to address occupational health-related topics such as emotional well-being, mental health, ergonomics, safety, lifestyle diseases and more. Well-equipped occupational health centers are available at all our campuses in India. During the year, doctors and physiotherapists have helped employees and their families through virtual consultations leveraging our telemedicine portal. More details on Occupational Health and Safety are available on our website at https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-health-safety.html. 10b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? We proactively identify occupational health and safety risks, for all existing / new / modified activities, processes, products or services, and regulatory changes, including routine and non-routine activities. Risk assessment includes quarterly evaluation of incidents that have occurred. Hazardous conditions, if any, are identified and prioritized for elimination and control. Once the identified hierarchy of controls is implemented, the risk assessment is revisited to assess the residual risks. As Infosys is an IT / ITES company, there are no product risks, but there are risks associated with the provision of services such as ergonomics at work and those associated with the operation of utilities and employees’ commute. Participation and consultation with relevant personnel involved in the activities is ensured during the risk assessments. Risks are also assessed before and after the development of new buildings. Experience from previous projects and ongoing operations is also considered. We continually monitor our construction sites where infrastructure is being built. More details on Occupational Health and Safety are available on our website at https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational- health-safety.html. 10c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y / N) Yes. We have a process for employees and ‘other than permanent’ employees to report work-related hazards. 10d.

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place. Infosys acknowledges that Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) is one of the key aspects of sustainable business practices. OH&S policies, processes, and practices at Infosys promote the physical, emotional, and social well-being of employees in the workplace. The robust Health and Safety Management system at Infosys has earned us the certification of ISO 45001:2018 for all Indian locations, including Infosys Limited and its subsidiaries, in line with our HSE strategy. The Company has implemented the following measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace: 1. Incident management: Incidents, which include near misses / potential hazards / accidents, are reported through internal applications or email. The causes of incidents are identified, analyzed and appropriate corrective actions are taken to prevent recurrence or occurrence of incidents leading to injuries / losses. 2. OH&S Committee: Both employees and contract workers are part of the Infosys OH&S Committee, which helps in ensuring their active participation and consultation. 3. Training and awareness: Training includes awareness building, mock drills, classroom sessions and periodic demonstrations. HSEMS training is a part of our employee induction program. To enable continuous learning, an HSE awareness module is available on Lex, our internal learning platform. For contract staff, job-specific and general training is provided during induction and later through refresher training. 4. Safety interventions: We have always focused on building a culture of safety at Infosys. The safety systems in place include work permits, trainings, Lock Out Tag Out (LOTO), safety inspections, audits, operational controls, and monitoring. Policies have been established focusing on specific areas such as women’s safety, lone working, transport, travel, construction and others. 5. Medical services: We have set up first aid centers on our campuses in India. Some of the first aid facilities are operational round the clock. Our telemedicine portal continues to operate and allows our employees to consult the doctors at our occupational health centers in India online. We have ambulance services available or have arrangements for ambulances to be made available at all our India-based locations. 6. Health Risk Assessment (HRA): HRA is conducted annually based on inputs from the OHC. Being an IT / ITES company, the prevalent risks include ergonomics, Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs), emotional well-being, etc., associated with the workplace, operation of utilities, and commute. Numerous initiatives, interventions, engagement virtual sessions, and process controls are in place to address these risks. 180 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 7. Programs on ergonomics: These include on-site physiotherapy centers, interventions by ergonomic experts and the provision of ergonomic infrastructure. 8. Physical and emotional well-being: We have nutritionists at our locations in India to provide counseling and guidance. We have also set up state-of-the-art gyms to train physical and mental fitness. 9.
