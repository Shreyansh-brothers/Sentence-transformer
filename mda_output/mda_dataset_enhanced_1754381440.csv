Infosys has been carbon neutral since fiscal 2020 across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Our approach to carbon neutrality is based on reducing and avoiding emissions through energy efficiency and renewable energy. Energy efficiency is achieved through super-efficient new buildings, industry-leading Energy Performance Index (EPI) <70 kWh/m2-yr, real-time monitoring and optimization of building operations through smart building systems, and retrofits in existing buildings. Infosys has implemented several retrofit projects (across air conditioning, lighting, and UPS systems) in the past and achieved a connected electrical load reduction of 36 MW across campuses in India. In fiscal 2024, we have undertaken a retrofit project to replace direct FCU units with chilled water units of air conditioning, which saved 1.1 lakh kWh and reduced emissions by 80.84 tCO2e. To achieve our goal of transitioning to clean energy, we have installed 60.2 MWp of solar PV capacity. 9.

The e-waste is always sent back to original manufacturers (under buyback schemes) or authorized recyclers who provide us certificates on the successful recycling and recovery of the material. Other hazardous waste like biomedical waste, oil-soaked cotton, oil filters from DG sets, and other trash are designated by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). These agencies incinerate the waste in compliance with rules and regulations. The resulting ash is diverted for use in the production of cement in a few places and delivered to Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility (TSDF) landfills for safe disposal. 11.

On the operations front, our Chakan plant achieved the highest milestone on its TPM journey. In 2024, it was awarded the ‘World Class TPM Award’ by Japanese Institute of Plant Maintenance [JIPM], making it the first automotive company in India to achieve this prestigious award. As your Company has been practicing TPM consistently for the last 25 years, in the last year Bajaj Auto also received the award for ‘Global Leaders Initiative for TPM’, a first for any Indian company. In the year gone by, we envisioned Project Velocity, built around the 4S Framework focusing on four key principles. This exercise involved a thorough analysis of our Business Units, leadership-led reviews, and iterative refinements to each unit’s organization structure. This was followed by a considered mapping of talent to key roles, ensuring alignment with business priorities, and stronger cross- functional collaboration. It resulted in simplification of the organization structure and flattening of the leadership layers to provide perfect correlation between our leadership levels, 4S framework and our leadership competency framework around - ● Simplicity of strategy - Anticipate the future with simplicity. ● Singularity of objectives - Drive singularity of alignment across the organization. ● Synergy of teams - Bring synergies by enabling the cross functional teams to continuously adapt to the dynamic environment. ● Speed of Execution - Act with speed in flawlessly executing and continuously improving. These changes have already started to positively impact agility, efficiency, and speed of execution in the Company. To round it all up therefore, as I reflect on the year gone by, for me it has brought home a profound business truth - in uncharted waters, competitiveness comes not from always having the wind at your back, but from being able to adroitly adjust your sails as the winds shift. Watching our teams rise to the challenge has been both energizing and gratifying. That we could do all this while staying true to our values, supporting our communities, and building for the future makes me proud not just of the performance but of the journey. Bajaj Auto Limited | 18th Annual Report 2024-25 9 NON-FINANCIALS CHAIRMAN’S LETTER As we shift gears to the next year, the environment has turned increasingly volatile, uncertain and complex. In these times, what keeps me reassured and optimistic is – 1. We are in a country which offers a sizeable market opportunity and growth potential at home 2. We have a well-regarded presence as ‘The World’s Favourite Indian,’ that allows us to serve and touch the lives of customers across 100 countries the world over 3. We have a well run business that is powered by a capable, committed and engaged team and supported by strong relationships with partners in the front and back end That said, I have no doubt that the road ahead will have its turns and bumps, as always. However, we are not standing still. We have a clear set of actions to revive domestic momentum, accelerate exports rebound, strengthen our products/proposition/presence, and continue to lead the transition toward electric mobility. We remain committed to: ● Driving the competitiveness in the strategically relevant and important 125cc+ motorcycle segment ● Scaling up Chetak even further with a view growing volumes, market share leadership and improving unit economics ● Expanding and replicating our market leadership to the electric three-wheelers segment, mirroring the strong position that we have built in the ICE category ● Sustaining and broad basing the recovery in exports, while leveraging the uptick across select overseas markets ● Staying the course relentlessly on delivering differentiated product innovation, impactful in- market activation and superior customer experience ● Investing sufficiently behind growth priorities, while building our strategic growth enablers and capabilities including through our subsidiaries ● Continuing the focus on dynamic financial management to ensure competitive and profitable growth with strong cash flow generation In closing, I wish to congratulate and thank our CEO and Managing Director, Rajiv Bajaj, and his exceptional leadership team, along with every member of the Bajaj Auto family — across plants, offices, and geographies — who made this year’s success possible. I would also like to commend our partners, our vendors, distributors, dealers, service providers and many more in the wider ecosystem who are deeply instrumental in enabling us deliver day in day out. We appreciate each contribution and take pride in these relationships. And to you, our shareholders — thank you for your continued trust. It is both our foundation and our fuel for the road ahead. We have done it this year. And with your support, I believe we will do it again in FY2026 — and better. Yours sincerely, Niraj Bajaj Chairman 10 Bajaj Auto Limited | 18th Annual Report 2024-25 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The IMF World Economic Outlook (January 2025) has estimated India’s real GDP growth in 2024-25 (FY2025) at 6.5%. This is significantly higher than all major countries in the world, including China. Moreover, it has projected the same growth rate - 6.5% for FY2026. This is very much in line with the estimates released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) of the Government of India. India has also seen continuing moderation of price inflation. Wholesale Price Index inflation has remained well under 4%. Inflation based on the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW) has stayed between 2% and 4%. And inflation based on the Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL) has steadily fallen a bit over 4% in February 2025. With no imminent fear of inflation, the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee, in its first meeting of FY2026, unanimously decided to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6 per cent. India’s current account deficit (CAD) for Q3 of FY2025 (October-December 2024) stood at 1.1% of GDP. For an economy growing 6.5% real with no near-term inflation risks, this is not a CAD that one should worry about. The Union Budget 2025 raised the income threshold for full tax rebates from H 7 lakh to H 12 lakh, effectively increasing disposable income for a broader segment of middle-income earners. This development is expected to bolster consumer sentiment and support discretionary spending. Given that this income group represents a significant share of two-wheeler and three-wheeler buyers, the measure is likely to have a positive impact on demand in the personal mobility segment. Amidst this good macroeconomic scenario, Bajaj Auto has performed better than ever before.

The Board of Directors have recommended a Final Dividend of J 210 per share, totalling to J 5,864 crores for FY2025. The said dividend would result in a payout of 72% of the Profits after Tax for the year. 12 Bajaj Auto Limited | 18th Annual Report 2024-25 Bajaj Auto Limited | 18th Annual Report 2024-25 13 NON-FINANCIALS MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Chart A: Revenue, EBITDA, Margin % and Profit after Tax REVENUE EBITDA % 60,000 30 50,000 25 20.2% 19.7% 40,000 17.1% 17.0% 17.8% 18.0% 20 15.9% 30,000 15 20,000 10 10,000 5 0 0 FY2019 FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024 FY2025 PAT 4,675 5,100 4,555 5,019 5,628 7,479 8,151 14 Bajaj Auto Limited | 18th Annual Report 2024-25 )erorC nI H( selaS teN 853,03 591,5 819,92 990,5 147,72 239,4 541,33 162,5 824,63 155,6 586,44 528.8 010,05 101,01 As a % of Margin Domestic Motorcycles The domestic motorcycles industry recorded modest growth of 5% in FY25 totalling of 12.25 million units. Compared to this, performance of Bajaj Auto is reflected in Table 1 below We remain focussed on growing the strategically important 125cc+ segment, with brands like Pulsar, Dominar, KTM, Husqvarna & Triumph. Our latest launch of Freedom brand, world’s first CNG bike is an attempt to upgrade the 100-110cc riders with an offering, which provides ~50% savings in operating costs, while also setting the new benchmarks of styling and comfort. We have noticed some pressure on the market share towards the second half of the year, and accordingly we have taken suitable product and pricing interventions to recoup the lost market share and continue to further expand the 125cc+ segment.

The India portfolio was expanded with 10 internationally acclaimed high- performance bikes (up to 1390cc) during the year, catering to different segments (Dirt, Enduro, Adventure and Street) to delight Indian sports motorcycling enthusiasts. ● Triumph sales were up >60% YoY aided by wider access as network expanded to 136 premium showrooms across 100 cities, each built to Triumph’s global standards and format, and new products (Speed T4, MY25 Speed) were well received. Domestic Three-Wheelers ICE industry recorded a decline of 4% this year vis a vis a 7% decline for Bajaj Auto. However, this loss in volumes was partially recouped by the growth in EV portfolio which grew 376% vs. 59% increase for the industry.

International Business Exports hit their peak volume in FY22, post covid, when the world was flushed with liquidity. However, the subsequent years—FY23 and FY24—posed significant challenges due to turbulent macro-economic conditions, including sharp local currency fluctuations and Fx unavailability in key international markets. These headwinds led to a notable decline in export volumes. As economic conditions begin to stabilize, FY25 signals a turning point, suggesting that the worst of the downturn is behind us. Early signs of a strong recovery are evident, with total export volumes rising to 1.86 million units in FY25, up from 1.64 million in FY24. This recovery is visible across both motorcycles and commercial vehicles, reaffirming Bajaj Auto’s resilience and adaptability in the face of external disruptions. Table 4 presents a yearly breakdown of this performance. In FY2025: ● Exports rebounded strongly to double digit volume and revenue growth ● Exports constitute 33.7% of our sales in FY25, versus 33.2% last year. ● Bajaj Auto sold over 1.86 million units — a growth of 13.9%. ● Both motorcycles and commercial vehicles recorded a double-digit growth. ● The LATAM region recorded the highest ever motorcycle sales.

Outlook We remain committed to strengthening our presence and delivering excellence across all segments we operate in. Our priorities for the coming year are multi-faceted. A key focus will be on restoring competitiveness in the strategically important 125cc+ motorcycle segment. We aim to unlock the full potential of the GoGo brand in the electric three-wheeler space, mirroring our leadership in the ICE category. The new Chetak range will be executed with the intent to significantly step up volumes and market share. We expect the export recovery to sustain, supported by improving macro-economic conditions. Multiple product launches across the KTM and Triumph portfolios are planned to further strengthen our global market positioning. Throughout this journey, we remain mindful of margin pressures arising from an increasingly competitive landscape and a strengthening rupee, and will navigate these challenges with disciplined execution. Risks & Opportunities In any business, risks and opportunities are two sides of the same coin and mastering both is essential to sustainable success. We recognize that the external environment is dynamic—whether it’s geopolitical shifts, regulatory changes, technological disruption, or supply-chain vulnerabilities—such evolving risks must be continuously scanned and anticipated. Guided by our robust Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, we systematically identify, assess, monitor, and govern these risks across the organization. Equally, we strive to convert uncertainties into strategic advantage—by developing response plans that not only mitigate threats but also position us to capture high-value opportunities through proactive response strategies and integrated business decision-making. This dual-focus approach ensures we are both resilient and agile—prepared to protect our business and nimble enough to seize tomorrow’s growth possibilities. Internal Control system and their adequacy Our company has established a comprehensive internal financial control (IFC) framework to ensure the integrity, reliability, and compliance of our financial reporting and operations. In accordance with Section 134(5)(e) of the Indian Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI LODR requirements, management and the audit committee annually assess the design and operating effectiveness of our IFCs, affirming their adequacy in supporting orderly business conduct and safeguarding assets. Our IFC system encompasses key elements—control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and ongoing monitoring—aligned with globally recognised frameworks like COSO and ICAI guidance. We maintain a robust process for documentation, periodical review, and Bajaj Auto Limited | 18th Annual Report 2024-25 17 NON-FINANCIALS MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS testing of controls through independent team, who report their findings to the management, with timely remediation of any gaps or deficiencies.

Furthermore, statutory auditors evaluate the operating effectiveness of IFCs under Section 143(3)(i) and have consistently reported no material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, underscoring the reliability of our financial disclosures. We acknowledge that while no system can offer absolute certainty, inherent limitations are managed through ongoing enhancements and policy updates to address evolving business risks. In summary, our internal financial control framework is well designed, diligently monitored, and tailored to our company's size and complexity—providing reasonable assurance on financial accuracy, fraud prevention, regulatory adherence, and effective oversight by our management.
